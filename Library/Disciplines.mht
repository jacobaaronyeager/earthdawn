presented in the Player‚Äôs Guide are not the end of what you can achieve a=

make use of for your character‚Äôs Discipline, both in respects to roleplay=

well as character creation and development, in the Earthdawn game. The
following chapters, each dedicated to one of the fifteen major Disciplines
known in Barsaive, contain fictional accounts written from the perspectives=
 of
actual followers of those Disciplines, which players can use as inspiration
when developing their characters. Each chapter also contains game informati=
on
for Ninth through Fifteenth Circle of a Discipline, and additional rules and
character options for your game of Earthdawn. These rules and character opt=

are introduced in this chapter on a general level. Some of them are optional
rules, some are guidelines for how to implement the rules in the individual
Discipline chapters, and some are additions that are usually only required =
for play
in higher Circles.</p>

perhaps a few examples of actions the character regards as taboo. A personal
vision can lend depth and focus to characters, providing a foundation for
future roleplaying. This statement of the character‚Äôs viewpoint may be an=

Because an adept‚Äôs power depends upon him acting in accordance with his
mystical world view, mentally straying too far from that world view causes =
the
adept to lose control of his talents. This phenomenon, known as a talent
crisis, usually occurs when an adept knowingly and freely behaves in a mann=

adepts often feel that their talents are slipping away. Sometimes they simp=

feel as if they have lost their edge; on occasion, any attempt to use their
talents fails outright. Gamemasters using the talent crisis rule should make
sure that characters‚Äô personal visions include prohibitions that will mak=

difference in play. Keep in mind that a personal vision is an adept‚Äôs core
belief, not just a list of minor habits. A Warrior who vows never to harm a
helpless foe is taking on a real restriction; a Wizard who has sworn never =

eat carrots is obviously the creation of a player seeking to avoid any seri=

feels that a player character has violated his personal vision or the basic
tenets of his Discipline, the gamemaster may apply a penalty to all Talent
Tests associated with the Discipline in question. The gamemaster must deter=

the severity of the violation, and should tell the player that the penalty =
is
in force. Adepts always recognize a talent crisis. A talent crisis does not
begin immediately after the violation, but manifests the next time the
character tries to use a talent of the violated Discipline. However, because
adepts instinctively know when they have violated their personal visions, t=
hey
immediately become anxious, feel guilty, suffer slight nausea, and so on. If
players do not acknowledge that their characters have violated their person=
al
visions, the gamemaster should take the initiative and state that the
characters are experiencing feelings of this kind. </p>

Passage: Taking 3 Strain, the adept can navigate the safest path through
unfamiliar territory by mentally contacting an air elemental. When caught i=
n a
major storm (such as that brought on by the Sky Raider‚Äôs Lightning Song
ability), the adept makes an Air Weaving Test against a Difficulty Number
determined by the gamemaster (see Travel Hazards in the Gamemaster‚Äôs
Companion), the Dispel Difficulty of the storm if it is magical, or the
opposing Sky Raider‚Äôs Sky Weaving Test Result on the first Lightning Song=
 Test.
As soon as he makes a successful Test, he finds a clear path: his ship is n=

damaged by the storm, and does not need to make any further tests for that
storm.</p>

I‚Äôd trust as I trust any of my mates. Both the Air Sailor and the Sky Rai=

have a freedom not granted to those who can‚Äôt take to the air; the differ=

the misfortune to meet a terrible, cloud-like Horror that Air Sailors call
Windrider. (Other folk may know this Horror by another name, but that‚Äôs n=
ot my
lookout. My concern was only to defeat it.) Me and my mate were the only Air
Sailors aboard, and the few survivors besides ourselves owe us their skins.
Windrider appeared sudden-like, out of airy nothing like the poet says, and
engulfed our poor ship in its foul smoky self. Any who stayed too long in i=
ts
billows had the skin stripped from his bones. The rest of the sailors‚Äînot
followers of the Discipline, mind you, but those we call airmen‚Äîstarted to
panic. They saw the blood of their mates flowin‚Äô over the decks, heard the
screaming, and started screaming themselves as they stabbed at the Horror w=
ith
swords and belt knives. As if stabbin‚Äô a cloud would do any good! </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Well, me and my

his
fall away from Windrider. Over and over he did this, taunting the Horror un=

it came after him. While he jumped and swung, I held the wheel, piloting the
ship high into the frigid air around the peaks of the Delaris Mountains. Wh=

got close enough, I rammed the airship into the ice-covered stone, trapping=
 the
Horror. Then Nestran‚Äîwho almost didn‚Äôt survive his final leap‚Äîhelped =

fire and the next passing airship picked us up. Cunning, courageous, and
looking out for others; that‚Äôs the nature of the Air Sailor. I reckon tha=
t some
day soon, the Namegivers will take back all of our skies from the winged

gives the Novice a little much-needed time to himself to absorb what‚Äôs be=
en
thrown at him. I know of some Air Sailors who train their Novices at all ho=
urs
of the day and night, thinking to teach them to be always ready for dangers
that may approach from any side. These Air Sailors are the mad folk who
actually enjoyed their time as a recruit. They believe that living in a
constant frenzy is the best way to handle the sudden storms and squalls of =
the
sailor‚Äôs life. Truly, though, that brand of Air Sailor burns twice as bri=
ghtly
for only half as long. Foolish, if you ask me. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>After a Novice
reaches a certain level of competence at the basic skills, he becomes a
Journeyman. Just as the Novice learned quickness, dexterity, and steadiness=
 of
body, so the Journeyman hones those skills of the wit. As a Journeyman, I h=
eld
responsibility for whole groups of other sailors; I had to see what needed
doing and tell them to do it, and I also planned strategies for any necessa=
ry
attacks and the ship‚Äôs defense. Among my other duties, it was also my tas=
k to
see that those in my charge followed the wind of their strengths and to keep
them from the tempests of their weaknesses. Young, inexperienced Air Sailors
began seeking me out and asking to train with me. I took them on, and judged
where fair weather and foul lay for each of them. Al l these things taught =
me
to use the talents of my Discipline that rely more on wit than raw power. A
mind as quick and graceful as a changeable spring gale is a Journeyman‚Äôs =
best
tool‚Äîand weapon, if need be. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>It was also as=
 a
Journeyman that I truly learned to appreciate my mates. A Journeyman looks =
out
over the deck of the ship and sees what needs doing, but he knows he can‚Äô=
t meet
all the needs of the ship himself. Instead, he does his own bit and makes s=
ure
others do theirs. An Air Sailor that reaches the Journeyman Circles of his
Discipline finally sees past his own immediate tasks. The look on the face =
of a
fellow who sees himself as part of a larger whole for the first time is the
same expression he had the first time he saw his hometown from the air. Ins=
tead
of feeling small and insignificant like some folk might think, he feels more
important and more useful than he ever has in his life because he can see t=
he
rigging ropes tying himself to his mates. You see a little bit of yourself =
in
those who train with you, and a bit of your own teachers in yourself. And o=
nce
you see that, you truly understand that to leave your mates means abandonin=
g a
piece of your own spirit. </p>

both agile wit and physical skill. Let me tell you, a Warden is one of the
slyest opponents you‚Äôll ever face. He‚Äôll use your own wits against you,=
 tie you
up in the ropes of your own cleverness. I once faced a ship whose crew serv=

ough
good candidates seem fewer these days than when I was young. A master has a
different life than any other Air Sailor; he serves only during the greates=

conflicts, and spends most of his time training young upstarts who pass the
recruit‚Äôs tests. Many master Air Sailors own ships or even shipbuilding
companies like my own Dawn Flier shipyards. To keep my mind sharp and my bo=

Sailors often use the expression ‚Äúnever leave your mates,‚Äù but few are =
ever
told this outright; rather, they are subtly encouraged to embrace the idea =
of
togetherness. Fellow Air Sailors may remind them to wait for a mate before
leaving a bar, or tell them to be aware of where their mates are aboard ship
during maneuvers. A natural extension of this camaraderie is a feeling of
obligation toward a fellow Air Sailor who needs aid on a mission or personal
quest. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Members of this
Discipline almost always adhere to some code of conduct. An Air Sailor is
expected to behave in a manner beyond reproach in front of outsiders. An Air
Sailor who speaks in an unacceptable manner might be drowned out by his pee=
rs
as they try to hide his indiscretion, or he might hear his own voice ringing
uncomfortably loud as his companions fall silent to shame him. The offending
party‚Äôs mates might even loudly defend him in public and then deal out
appropriate punishment after the crew returns to the ship. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Another common=
 trait
of Air Sailors is a tendency to be ‚Äúfar seeing.‚Äù Many Air Sailors have
elaborate long-term plans of some sort‚Äîowning a ship, freeing the lands a=
round
Sky Point from Theran domination, and so on. That plan often becomes that
character‚Äôs driving goal; he will never stop planning how to achieve it. =

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Nearly all Air
Sailors follow some kind of informal code, the exact details of which depen=
d on
the individual character‚Äôs personal vision. An Air Sailor who fails to fo=
llow
his personal code risks suffering a talent crisis. In addition, an Air Sail=
or
who chooses to flout the expectations of his fellow Air Sailors is likely to
suffer a talent crisis, because a common emphasis of the Discipline is the
brotherhood and companionship of a crew. If the adept is in a supervisory or
command position, such a crisis could threaten the cohesion of the entire c=
rew.
The way of the Air Sailor is built on cooperation and working towards a com=
mon
goal for the common good, adepts acting as loners and following their own
devices and vices rarely make it as Air Sailors, even if part of an adventu=
ring
group instead of a ship‚Äôs crew. </p>

Namegiver races, but few units actively recruit outside of the militias in
larger cities, as airships seldom stop in the countryside. </p>

traditionally opposed to the way of the Air Sailor include the Nethermancer,

write a document for him that he may put in his book. His meandering words

 possession
of what we want is his missile. Using the art of seeing, we can determine t=
hat
cooperation with his aims is the most effective missile for us‚Äîthe superi=

means of striking our target. Therefore, we agree to write what the paper
shuffler wants in exchange for what we desire. We have perhaps lost some
dignity, and definitely some time. But we have hit both our targets, and th=

between devotees of the bow and adherents of the crossbow. When an Archer f=

a missile at a target, the Archer sees the arc between weapon and foe, thus
forging a mystical connection between the Archer and his chosen‚Äô weapon. =
In a
sense, we see through our weapons as other Namegivers see through their eye=

An Archer‚Äôs choice of weapon reveals something about him, and throughout =
his
life that choice continues to shape and mold him. I wield the longbow, and =
have
had the honor of fighting beside many practitioners of the crossbow. This is
what I have seen: crossbowmen tend to be earthy and practical. We of the bow
possess a mystical bent, a taste for metaphor. The crossbowman works by
pragmatic logic, the bowman by intuition. </p>

make it. Through the eyes of my bow I feel a bond to nature, the world of t=

forest and jungle. I am connected to the tree from which the wood of my bow=
 was
born, and so am at home in the woodlands. Among trees and vines and creeper=
s, I
can pick out furtive movements and see hidden dangers. I am connected to the
skilled, solitary artisan who carved my bow. Many, like me, carve their bows
themselves. Therefore, I am self-reliant, accustomed to solving problems by=
 my
own instincts. Within my bow, as within my chest, beats the heart of a lone=

We bowmen are serious by nature, and when we act heroically it is often for
such abstract motives as a desire for justice or the dictates of personal
honor. </p>

weapon he sees through is the product of mechanical ingenuity, he sees the
world as pieces interlocking to achieve a desired effect. Moreover, the
crossbowman‚Äôs weapon is the result of cooperation between woodworker and
metalsmith. Neither the wood nor metal in his weapon is worth anything on i=
ts
own; they must smoothly combine to form a useful whole. The Archer therefore
sees the ideal man as one who works easily with others for the achievement =
of a
mutual goal. His diplomatic instincts are more acute than those of the bowm=

he often acts as the steady head in a party of squabbling adventurers. </p>

crossbowman is likelier than a bowman to have laugh lines around his eyes, =
is
easier in his demeanor and quicker to tell a joke. Tied to metal, and throu=

targets for his hungry arrows. In the mind of the Archer, the arrows in his
quiver are like peeping baby birds, anxious to be loosed at the foe and dri=

of his blood. A true Archer keeps the violence within him in check. He only
fires at the right moment for the scenario in which he finds himself. In our
True patterns, this savage part of our natures is connected to our eyes, an=
d so
they must maintain this restraint. Our eyes, always alert to discern target
from missile or foe from friend, serve us as our consciences. Without our
capacity to see and judge truly, we become less than beasts. Sadly, the gif=
t of
judgment does not always accompany the art of sight. As with any Discipline,
the way of the Archer is cursed with its share of villains. We refuse to ho=

s,
and dogs abound there. In truth, however, it is difficult to learn of the f=

companion an untamed city cat, rat, or bird in order to learn the lessons of
its independent spirit. Would-be adepts who find wild-spirited companions in
the untamed lands of Barsaive usually travel with a better guide through the

Some
Beastmasters find their way through the first veil without a teacher‚Äôs
guidance, though only under unusual circumstances. An ork Beastmaster of my
acquaintance, M‚Äôrok Grimshock, followed the Cavalryman Discipline before
undergoing the transformation that led him to the Beastmaster‚Äôs path. Tho=

true friend to his mount, he knew nothing of the ways of other animals. He =

not even like them much; they made him uneasy. </p>

steep ravine. His companions, unaware of his fate, gave him up for dead when
the fighting ended. All night, Grimshock sat beside his gravely injured mou=

stormed the deaf heavens with tears and cried in memory of his slain compan=

still felt for his dead mount, but the beasts responded to something in
Grimshock‚Äîrather than slay him and devour both bodies, the beasts mourned=
 with
the Cavalryman. In the dawn of that sad day, Grimshock broke through the ve=

He saw the animals‚Äô hearts, and they comforted him. Later that day, Grims=
hock
returned to his fellows on the back of a huge, brown bear. From that time
forward, Grimshock studied the ways of the Beastmaster, and has become
legendary throughout Barsaive. (In Grimshock‚Äôs version of the tale, he ta=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Once the Beast=
master
sees through the first veil, she can begin reaching the minds of the beasts.
Many people believe that training an animal means forcing your will upon it,
but this is not so. A Beastmaster must possess a strong will, but only beca=
use no
animal will bond with a weakling. Weakness is dangerous, for a weak animal
swiftly succumbs to peril. A Beastmaster must prove to the creatures she tr=
ains
that she is strong and knows what needs doing. She does this not by forcing=
 the
beast to follow her, but by clearly showing the creature the direction she
intends to go. All creatures know when to follow a leader. Show them that y=
ou
are such, and the beasts cannot help but fall in line. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Consider the w=
olf
and the cougar. One hunts alone, the other follows the leader of its pack. =
Yet
both recognize the weakness of their prey, and that is why they attack. And
both will come at the call of a strong Beastmaster; a weak and undisciplined
Beastmaster, they abandon. They can see strength and weakness at a glance, =
and
know the difference between them. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>A Beastmaster =
must
also have patience, for it takes time to build the trust that truly command=
s an
animal. You cannot simply flash them an empty smile full of charm and hope =
to
win them over. Animals know nothing of flattery. They see what is before th=
em
and respond to it. A Beastmaster must therefore also know her own flaws and=
 how
best to overcome or hide them. If you stink, beasts do not politely hold th=
eir
breath and stay near you. If you speak loudly and foolishly, they do not li=
sten
patiently while you babble. If you are drunk, they do not carry you back to
your pallet to sleep it off. The beasts of the world will not bear your fla=
ws;
they react to those they see and ignore what you do not flaunt at them. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Patience lets a
Beastmaster bond with many creatures by learning how each expects to be
treated. Patience builds trust and shows a beast your worth. Patience is the
soul of self-mastery. Only if you prove your worthiness to a creature can y=
ou
teach that creature. After all, a trained beast gives us far more than we g=
ive
it. We train them to work for our needs, not for theirs. If we want the bea=
st
we train to give of its best for a far lesser return, we must be worthy of =
such
a gift. Therefore, after we have taught the horse the way in which we need =
it
to carry us, we must then recognize what it needs in return, and fill that =
need
as best we can. A Beastmaster who does this receives the willing service of=
 a
companion who will never betray her. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>One who has ac=
quired
an animal companion and pierced the first veil is a novice, known to other
Beastmasters as a tyro. A tyro does whatever is needed to deepen her
understanding of many beasts‚Äô ways, often earning her daily bread taming =
and
training workbeasts for others. In addition to animal ways, this work teach=
es
the tyro more of the ways of her fellow Namegivers by requiring her to disc=
over
whether they are deserving of a beast‚Äôs labor or not. Turning a trained b=
east
over to a neglectful or abusive master violates the trust between beast and
tyro; it is the worst deceit of which a novice Beastmaster can be guilty. S=
uch
a betrayal, whether knowing or unknowing, can only serve to impede the
Beastmaster‚Äôs growth in her Discipline. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>When a tyro has
learned to understand many different creatures, she tests herself by forgin=
g a
bond between creatures that are natural enemies, using their mutual trust of
her to bring them together. If she succeeds in this, she becomes a Journeym=
an,
or par. I achieved that station by calling upon creatures of land and sea to
save a troll child stranded on a friend‚Äôs raft from floating away. I pers=
uaded
several giant salmon to push the raft downriver to a ford, where a family of
bears waded into the shoulder-high waters and stopped the raft‚Äôs descent.=
 None
of the bears so much as glanced at the salmon, though great salmon are a be=

favorite delicacy. </p>

becomes a par, she tests her own skills against the strength of the beasts =
of
the land. Such tests are often solitary, including such acts as attending t=

birth of wild animals, or joining a pack of animals and being accepted as o=
ne of
them. Some pars begin working with only magical beasts. A par must set hers=
elf
the most exacting tests possible, and repeat them until she can meet their
challenges. A Beastmaster who does this may rightly claim the status of War=
den.
Though it is the par herself who determines when she has become a Warden,
rather than a teacher, she may only claim this status when inner truth tells
her that she merits it. </p>

feel drawn to all types of beasts, desiring to work with and learn from them
all. Such a one loves nothing more than learning the ways of an unfamiliar
animal, and often travels across the land in search of more and more differ=
ent
creatures with whom to bond. I have known such many-minded Beastmasters to
spend years wandering through wild lands, seeking fantastical animals who e=
xist
only in rumor or legend. Barsaive owes these devoted Beastmasters a debt be=
yond
price, for it is they who bring back tales of the unusual creatures they ha=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Still other
Beastmasters are drawn to magical beasts. I have known pars and wardens who=

thrive on challenge that they work only with magically endowed creatures,
finding all others too biddable for their liking. It is indeed a much great=

challenge to prove oneself a worthy leader to an animal capable of wielding
magic! Some magical Beastmasters believe that the secret to all beasts‚Äô

claim that certain beasts developed magical abilities because of the Scourg=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>I have also met
certain Beastmasters who call themselves Scouts. These, more than any, wish=
 to
learn from the beasts in order to help themselves, rather than to learn
self-mastery. More than one young Scout has come to me for training, seeking
the gift of knowledge so that they may borrow the sharp nose of the wolf or
walk the silent tread of the cat. Too often, regrettably, their interest st=
ops
there. They are quick to pick up certain talents, and if they had the proper
devotion to their Discipline, they could become able Beastmasters. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>To the everlas=
ting
sorrow of every true Beastmaster, some of our number enslave the beasts who
trust them. Such folk most often work only for profit and know nothing of
self-mastery. Because the bonds formed between these Beastmasters and their
animals are flawed and weak, such enslaved beasts often break free from the=
ir
captivity or perish in the attempt. Such tragedies only serve to hide the
secrets of the beasts deeper from us, because they teach the beasts to run =
from
the Namegiver races. The Beastmaster who forsakes her duty to treat the
creatures of the land with respect in return for power or coin can scarcely=
 be
called a Beastmaster, save that she has certain talents of our Discipline.
Those of us who live by higher ideals know it is a sin to abuse our
Discipline‚Äôs magic and so dishonor the noble creatures who survived the
Scourge. We who follow the true path shun the lesser Beastmaster, and no
honorable teacher will train one. Just as stronger animals leave the weak a=

sickly to heal or die alone, so we leave the Beastmaster who exploits her
animals to suffer the pangs of her own conscience. </p>

the tale of such a lesser Beastmaster, Named Kreg Shuerslan, who lived in
Bartertown. Each year he paid others to capture animals from the wilds and
bring them to his stable. There he whittled away at their hearts and minds,
forcing his will upon them with lash and stick, preparing them for service =
in
the mines or on farms or as pack animals for adventurers. Drunk with his own
power, he enslaved all creatures on whom he could lay his brutal hands: even

many hearty souls together for his espagra-hunting expedition. One of their
number was a windling Troubadour, brought along to commemorate the event wi=

r, by
nature, spends a great deal of time with the beasts of the wilds. Traveling=
 the
untamed lands in search of new creatures is exciting, but also full of haza=
rds.
A Beastmaster must not allow her interest in strange animals to overshadow
caution when approaching such beasts, lest she be entrapped by a Horror usi=
ng
some animal-like construct as a lure. A Beastmaster is a great prize for a
Horror; if these abominations from other-where can pervert our Discipline‚Ä=
ôs
magic, they may use the Beastmaster‚Äôs talents to create bestial servants.=
 Such
tainted animals can be the Horror‚Äôs eyes and ears to far-off villages and
towns; they may run mad under the Horror‚Äôs touch and maim or kill all in =
their
path. If a Horror uses the Beastmaster‚Äôs bond to taint a magical beast, t=
he
beast‚Äôs powers are turned to the Horror‚Äôs will, causing untold destruct=
ion. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Worse than thi=
s,
however, is the corruption of the very fabric of nature by a Horror-tainted
Beastmaster. Through a Beastmaster‚Äôs mind and heart, a Horror can manipul=
ate
the first veil, warping it so that the Beastmaster sees only the brutality =
that
that Horror wants the Beastmaster to absorb. The Beastmaster‚Äôs tainted si=
ght in
turn taints the veil, so that the darkness of it forever destroys the
possibility of trust between beast and Namegiver. Sometimes, though less of=
ten,
the Horror will cloud the veil, showing the beasts in a dimmed light so that
the Beastmaster will overestimate her power over them. Many Beastmasters die
under this foul influence, however, and few Horrors will slay quickly if th=
ey
can torment a soul for years. </p>

always allay these fears, as many folk are unaccustomed to Beastmasters and=
 our
ways. Art is a better way to prove one‚Äôs purity, and gives the artist muc=

besides. Some Beastmasters engage in body painting, and a true master of th=
is
art can achieve a masterpiece that rivals even the loveliest embroidered
creations. Others of us practice sculpture of stone or wood. I am a woodcar=

kind
of roleplaying, even during adventures that might not otherwise focus on the
Beastmaster and/or his creatures. If a Beastmaster regularly travels with o=
ne
or more animals, the gamemaster should not conveniently forget these beasts
when the character enters an inn or goes into combat. The player may want to
control the beasts‚Äô actions, but ideally those decisions should come from=

the river, sharing its ever-flowing nature by becoming restless wanderers on

revolves around her horse, and the horse‚Äôs around the Cavalryman. Nothing=
 is as
important to a Cavalryman as caring for her mount, and she will see to her
mount‚Äôs comfort even before breaking her fast. The Cavalryman feeds her h=

and curries it, then checks its legs for splints and its hooves for signs of
thrush, stone bruises or other problems. A Cavalryman can often sense if her
mount is in pain or gravely ill; some troubles can be insidious, and so it =
pays
to be cautious. A mount‚Äôs legs and hooves must be well cared for, because=
 a
horse whose leg or hoof is seriously injured may never recover. To lose a m=

whatever is required of them; patrolling the outskirts of cities or towns,

fighting‚Äîthough battle has become rarer since the end of the Theran War. =
In all
such activities, the Cavalryman must give constant attention to strengtheni=

the link between the spirits of rider and horse. At the end of the day, when
mount and rider retire to rest, they often sleep together. All Cavalrymen s=

often arrange to stay near the pregnant animal until the birth of the offsp=
ring,
and spend much of the time while they wait searching for Cavalrymen candida=
tes.
When the foal is born, the Cavalryman spends a day with the newborn animal,
stroking its rough coat and whispering tales of glory and valor in its ears,
all the while concentrating her thoughts on the potential adepts she identi=
fied
earlier. If no one responds to this call, we accept that this youngling was=

then offers to train the foal as a mount for the candidate. If the candidate

before becoming so intimately bound up with another. Other Cavalryman belie=

just as strongly that the apprentice rider and foal should not be parted on=

they have bonded, however tentatively. They say that continuous company and
shared experiences strengthen the bond between horse and rider, and make th=

teacher and mount, the newly bonded horse and rider each receive a mark of
joining. Though derived by custom from the mark worn by the teaching pair, =
it
is always different enough so that each mark is as unique as the pair it bi=

The mark may be branded on the new pair with fire, or tattooed, or the teac=
her
may cut the flesh and rub dirt into the cut to form a raised scar. I have h=
eard
that ork scorchers favor the last method. Once adorned with this symbol of =
the
Cavalryman‚Äôs bond, the rider leaps onto his mount‚Äôs back for the first =
time. As
the two gallop together in joy, the rider silently Names their partnership.
This Naming cements the budding heart-bond between the two of them. No
Cavalryman tells another this Name, and to ask it is a deadly insult. </p>

survivor
of a pair sundered by death, whether horse or rider, may bond again, though=
 no
Cavalryman can bond with more than one mount at a time. Such a thing would =
be a
travesty; it would be like a king owing his whole loyalty to more than one
realm, or a husband giving all his heart to more than one wife. None among =

has discovered precisely why, but it is far rarer for a horse to bond again

 the
least likely to find another mount, partly because their notions of honor a=
re
tangled with the pair-bond and partly because it is no easy task to find a
mount suitable to their size. Regardless, no Cavalryman of any race ever
completely sets aside her sense of loss. We always remember our mounts, and
miss them as a mother misses her departed children. Some Cavalrymen never
recover from the shock of losing a mount, particularly if they feel somehow=
 to
blame for the horse‚Äôs death. Such unending despair is a hazard of our
Discipline. Because a Cavalryman‚Äôs horse lives at most to the age of twen=

the bone as strong as it once was, and no horse cares to live on three legs=
. A
horse that can never gallop again knows only a life of agony. We Cavalrymen
have a duty to our mounts if they are injured so grievously that life will
become unbearable for them. If in battle or accident a horse suffers a
crippling, but not fatal wound, the Cavalryman must perform the Rite of the
Hero. To leave your mount alive and suffering rather than face this awful a=
nd
solemn responsibility is the single greatest shame that can befall a
Cavalryman. Horses can sense such shame, and an adept who so disgraces hers=
elf
will never find another horse willing to accept her after such a betrayal. I
have heard the few scattered stories of Zena of Throal, a dwarf Cavalryman =

 her
mount‚Äôs neck, then touches her dying mount‚Äôs blood to the marks of their
joining. As the mount dies, the joining brand fades (though it never fades
entirely). I performed this rite for my first mount, Dancer, who gave his l=

You‚Äôll give him heart failure with a demand like that! Certain aspiring

difficult. In order to work our magic best, we need the aid of different

the
Elementalist Discipline doesn‚Äôt tend to attract hordes of would-be

The Discipline is too subtle for that sort of nonsense. Instead, we watch
non-adepts for signs that they respect the elements or are sensitive to the=
ir
workings. I found my latest apprentice, a young innkeeper‚Äôs daughter, whe=

elements. Weather-sense or some such isn‚Äôt enough by itself; an apprentic=
e must
be able to learn the Discipline. Often, an adept places the would-be appren=
tice
where one or another of the elements clearly holds sway; they go walking in=
 a
rainstorm together, or stand near a bonfire. The adept then asks his compan=

what he sees and feels. If the answers are promising, the adept formally as=

the candidate if he wishes to become an apprentice. My young apprentice hea=

unintelligible whispers and felt a cold breeze in her hair when a storm was

Fifth Circle and beyond have the greatest trouble, because of the sheer
complexity of the task they must accomplish. These Elementalists must
demonstrate their power in front of an elder adept and a number of spirits
equal to the desired Circle. But the more elemental spirits are present, the
more chances there are for disputes among them that can keep the ritual from
happening. Innumerable Elementalists have been stymied by feuding elemental
spirits, or their own short-sighted treatment of one. Other difficulties
include convincing enough spirits to attend the ritual without too much fus=
s,
and inevitably at least one of them will demand that the Elementalist perfo=
rm a
service for them in exchange. Most Elementalists consider these services pa=
rt
of the Discipline, of course. As long as the elemental does not demand
something that might throw off the balance of the elements, these services =
are
of as much value to the adept as to the spirit. </p>

demonstrate the adept‚Äôs prowess of eradicating Horrors and their spawn. T=

Names of the fallen get recited by other Horror Stalkers, making sure that
their deeds are never forgotten. However, all Horror Stalkers must constant=
ly
prove that they are free of taint before receiving further training. Horror

Stalkers care about their numbers, but finding Namegivers with the needed
strength of will and determination is a daunting task. As a result, Horror
Stalkers often recruit and initiate their numbers on the battlefield and pl=

where the Horrors have left survivors.</p>

their efforts at rooting them out rarely go unnoticed by the public. Any Ho=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Ghost Master R=
itual:
The Horror Stalker paces out a large circle outlining it with salt and begi=
ns a
Litany similar to the one recited when performing a Karma Ritual. However,
instead of Naming a number of Horror Stalkers, he recites the deeds of his =
ghost
master only, Naming all the Horrors known to have been struck down by him.
After finishing his recitation (which often takes more than an hour), the
desired ghost master appears within the salt circle and the ritual proceeds=
 as
normal.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Many Horror St=

learn the Discipline as a second Discipline, driven by a burning revenge for
the loss of those who were dearest to them. Many Horror Stalkers get initia=

at sites of destruction where the Horrors have left survivors‚Äîlost kaers =

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The Nethermanc=

Weaponsmith Disciplines are almost perfect matches for the Horror Stalker s=
ince
both feature similar mindsets. The Nethermancer seeks knowledge of the astr=
al
realms and their denizens, and the Discipline also deals with conquering fe=
ar.
The Weaponsmith is typically strong willed, seldom backs down, and is able =
to
create and maintain the necessary tools of war needed to fight the Horrors.=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The Wizard, Sc=
out,
Archer, Illusionist, and Warrior Disciplines are also good matches for the
Horror Stalker. The Wizard tries to unravel the secrets of the world, and h=
is
knowledge helps to understand the enemy better. The Scout mindset allows the
Horror Stalker to see the influence of Horrors in the environment and adds =
an
element of stealth the Horror Stalker lacks. The Archer‚Äôs traditionally d=
irect
approach matches the Horror Stalker‚Äôs seek-and- destroy approach to fight=
ing
the Horrors. Illusionists offer fantastic abilities to deceive the enemy, a=
nd
are usually concerned with finding the truth‚Äîa useful focus for rooting o=
ut
Horror influence. Finally, the Warrior complements and greatly improves the
Horror Stalker‚Äôs prowess in combat, and his dedication to winning the bat=
tle
complements the Horror Stalker‚Äôs single mindedness.</p>

dependence often oppose the Horror Stalker‚Äôs mindset‚Äîfriends, relatives=
, and
companions are prime targets for a Horror‚Äôs corruption, and putting those=
 at
risk is something Beastmasters, Air Sailors, and Cavalrymen generally try to
avoid. The Swordmaster‚Äôs view of the world often opposes the Horror Stalk=
er‚Äôs
mindset since Swordmasters typically live for the flashy fight, not the kil=

Troubadours generally prefer to live and talk about their experiences and t=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Most other
Disciplines are neutral to the Horror Stalker‚Äôs mindset, but their abilit=

have the ability to create enchantments that help against the Horrors, but =
they
seek balance in the world which can‚Äôt be achieved by single-mindedly focu=
sing
on the opposition. Sky Raiders live in battle, but are usually focused on t=
he
survival of their crew and moot. The Thief mindset (especially that of the
selfish Thief) fits the loner attitude of the Horror Stalker and offers
abilities to circumvent traps and sneak past the opposition, but the
straightforward approach of confronting an enemy generally opposes the Thie=
f ‚Äôs
tendency to hide in the shadows. Followers of these Disciplines typically d=
on‚Äôt
become Horror Stalkers unless they have strong reason to.</p>

Interpreted: For 4 Strain, the adept makes an Illusionism Test to create an
illusory environment. The adept may change every part of his surroundings
within 50 yards, and a Disbelief Test against the Illusionism Test result is
required to see through every single change. Objects that the adept changes
cannot cause any effect besides fooling the senses. They cannot, for exampl=
e,
cause damage. While the adept can change everything in the area, the changes
abruptly stop at a distance of 50 yards from him, so they might fade out if=
 he
moves or, when changing the ground below him, be obvious to a perceptive
onlooker. The illusions and ability to make changes last for 10 minutes, but
the adept may extend this without interruption by taking the Strain again.<=

Men and women alike fainted at the sight of phantasmal dragons rushing towa=

that others will learn to look closely at all things magical. Magic can be
beneficial, but can also pose grave danger. We left the kaers, but we have =

left behind all the dangers from which they sheltered us. Horrors still roam
the land at will, and we Illusionists fear that our fellow Namegivers may h=

little town was always on the verge of collapse, and I used my talents
constantly to keep the people from despair. I learned that the town had beg=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Training is a
never-ending series of tests and illusions that can drive many a student to
complete distraction. In fact, they are meant to do precisely that. The best
metal requires the hottest fire, and only stringent training will make a
worthwhile Illusionist. Teachers often place their students in the middle of
incredibly vivid, lifelike illusions, then giggle hysterically as the stude=
nt
blunders around in search of a way out. This is the essence of training wit=
h an
Illusionist. You no longer accept things as real simply because you see or =
hear
or smell them. Instead, you test and test and test again absolutely everyth=
ing
before you accept its reality. Of course, one must also become very thorough
and very fast at testing reality. Most Illusionists excel at making accurate
judgments based on small details. Without swift and accurate analysis, an
Illusionist‚Äôs life would become a never-ending series of tiny, cautious s=
teps
in the face of possible peril. What can you possibly hope to accomplish by =

Discipline is every bit as demanding as learning it. The teacher must be
several steps ahead of the pupil in order to create illusions and cast spel=
ls
that the student will find nearly impossible to disbelieve. Most Illusionist
teachers are far more advanced than their pupils. A Third Circle Swordmaster
may very well be able to instruct one of First or Second Circle, but not so=
 an
Illusionist. A student rarely learns anything of value from a teacher of a
Circle less than three above her own level of ability; most of the time, the
difference is five Circles or more. As you might guess, good teachers are in
great demand. The best ones often have lists a year and a day long of stude=
nts
waiting for their attention. An Illusionist who finds a good teacher should=
 do
everything possible to stay in his or her good graces. If you find a ghost
master, so much the better; they can teach some truly extraordinary things!
Teaching is time-consuming, and a teacher rarely has time for much adventur=
ing
while instructing a pupil. Most teachers take long breaks between students =
in
order to accomplish deeds by which they can advance in the Discipline
themselves. Some Illusionists prefer to give up adventuring for a few years

unique methods for determining when an adept is ready to proceed to the next
Circle, and we Illusionists are no different. The way in which we mark
advancement, however, is different indeed. In most other Disciplines, an ad=
ept
is given some kind of test to determine his readiness to learn more, and th=
ese
tests are the same (or nearly so) for all. Staggering under the weight of
tradition, these tests admit no changes, great or slight, to better suit th=
em
to the individual practitioner. Illusionists see the folly in this way of
testing. Why test different students the same way? We tailor our rituals for
Circle advancement to each teacher and student, and so more truly measure
progress. More than one teacher may use the same form of ritual but each
student learns from that ritual in a different way. So for me to speak of t=
his
ritual or that ritual would do your book no good, and certainly won‚Äôt ser=

to choose which to defend against. (I passed that test with my usual flair,=
 of
course.) Magical duels to the first blood sometimes serve as advancement ri=

with elegant illusions cloaking the damaging real spells as they fly toward
their target. In truth, the only limit to an Illusionist‚Äôs advancement ri=

Illusionist everyone despises, especially those of us who care about our
Discipline. Any real Illusionist will warn you away from these despicable
liars. Shortly after Barsaive‚Äôs people left the kaers, certain Illusionis=
ts
allowed the acquisition of silver to concern them more than teaching the wo=
rld
to see the truth. These adepts and their dishonorable descendants continue =
to
travel across Barsaive, bilking the gullible out of their fortunes and work=
ing
‚Äúmiracles‚Äù for fantastic sums of money. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>A charlatan
possesses little or no knowledge of real magic. All his spells are illusory,
save those that affect himself alone. Charlatans show exceptional skill at
creating illusions, but once those illusions are dispelled or disbelieved he

 protest
that injustice, I urge readers of this discourse to remember that charlatans
exist. Not all of them have rotted wood for hearts, though‚Äîmany are much =

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>For most Illus=

characters, nothing is as it appears. An Illusionist‚Äôs talents allow her =
to
alter reality to suit her whims, and she assumes that other powers existing=
 in
the world do the same. An Illusionist is therefore far less likely than oth=
ers
to take things at face value, and enjoys investigating oddities in order to
understand them. Of course, Illusionists usually know enough to accept as r=
eal
those things that present an imminent and obvious threat (for example, by
eating one of his companions). An Illusionist may spend one or two brief
moments inspecting the threat for flaws that might indicate its falsity, but
she will not simply stand there disbelieving in the thing while it does her
injury. </p>

often entertainers at heart. They love delighting crowds with their magic, =
and
often perform without being asked. They typically regard their entertainmen=
t as
filling two vital needs: providing amusement to lighten dark hours, and giv=
ing
the common folk a lesson in how to perceive the truth. Most Illusionists see
truth as being more subtle and elusive than people perceive through their
senses. Through their illusions, they demonstrate how easily the senses can=
 be
befuddled, and teach that reality is not always what it seems. Illusionists
often go out of their way to explain their motives to onlookers; if suffici=
ent
silver is not forthcoming or the crowd does not seem suitably impressed by =
the
illusory display, many Illusionists resort to sermonizing on the nature of
truth in the hope of shaming people into paying up. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Because of the
transitory nature of illusion magic, the Illusionist Discipline has few true
traditions that are passed down from master to student. This makes
generalizations about followers of the Discipline difficult, and a Discipli=
ne
violation for one adept is less likely to hold true for another. Some of the
more common violations include relying too heavily on ‚Äúreal‚Äù magic inst=
ead of
illusions, abandoning the search for truth behind the world‚Äôs fa√ßade, or=
 taking
the world at face value. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The masters of
illusion refuse to subscribe to established rituals. An elder improvises ea=
ch
advancement ritual, and ideally the adept never realizes the ritual has beg=
un

pretext for the adept to learn and use a new spell or talent of the appropr=
iate
Circle. Troubadours recite with glee the Twelve Rites of Master Jonwal, who=
se
mentor devised brilliant, devious rituals to test Jonwal as he advanced. He
failed to even suspect the tests she set him while advancing through the
Twelfth Circle, only recognizing her illusion when he advanced to Thirteenth
Circle. This amazing level of deception has never been duplicated. During
Jonwal‚Äôs progress, both mentor and adept suffered several mental breakdow=

Illusionists recruit new adepts privately by watching for candidates in the=
ir
everyday travels, then testing likely candidates in some way suited to their
Discipline. Illusionists often recruit compulsive liars into their Discipli=
ne,
choosing people whose reputations precede them so far that adepts can easily
track them down. An Illusionist who decides to recruit a candidate usually
approaches his target masked by an rudimentary illusion, then engages the
compulsive liar in conversation. If the candidate penetrates the illusion, =
the
Illusionist may offer to initiate Talents and Abilities him or her into the

The Illusionist learns and unerringly performs the ghost master ritual of
another Discipline. If the Ghost Master Ritual Test succeeds, the Illusioni=
st
summons a ghost master of that Discipline. The Illusionist gives this ghost
master an illusory orichalcum coin and must persuade him or her to bring an
Illusionist ghost master when he returns in three days. At the next summoni=

the Illusionist ghost master appears and receives a true orichalcum pledge

abilities help make this combination a master of larceny. The Troubadour
Discipline also blends well, as the adept can use illusion magic to enhance=

well-suited to the Illusionist, as magicians typically spend years honing t=

ry,
as illusion can be used to enhance the flashiness of combat, and the
Swordmaster‚Äôs social talents blend well with Illusionist abilities. Despi=
te the
shared focus on spellcasting, Illusionists rarely work well with a magician
Discipline as their second choice. The additional spells often drive the ad=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Liberators do =
not
observe formal advancement rituals, as their deeds usually speak for
themselves. A Liberator who cannot confirm sufficient deeds for his level of
capability is often not trained until he does. This tradition ensures there=
 are
few Liberators preaching high ideals, but not following through with their
actions.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Recruitment:
Liberators are often recruited from the ranks of freed slaves, usually those
who stood out during their escape. When a Liberator notices a potential
student, he often holds back helping him, to find out how well his candidate
can do on his own once the spark of rebellion has entered his mind.</p>

The Liberator walks into an abandoned prison cell, cellar, or cave and sits
with his back against the wall as if he were a prisoner. After an hour anot=
her
prisoner appears sitting beside him. If the Ritual of the Ghost Master Test=
 succeeds,
the Liberator and the ghost master talk about how to plan their escape. The
ritual proceeds as normal once both leave their prison.</p>

choose to follow the path of the Air Sailor because of its focus on teamwork
and coordination. It also appeals to Liberators hoping to free those enslav=
ed
on Theran airships. Following the way of the Beastmaster appeals to those
seeking to free animals mistreated by their owners (those forced to fight in
arenas, for example).</p>

hoices
include the Archer, Scout, Illusionist, and Warrior Disciplines, which offer
talents that enhance the Liberator‚Äôs abilities to help and free others.
Liberators who choose the Weaponsmith as a secondary Discipline often
concentrate on the art of creating and concealing small weapons for use in
raids on slave camps. Some Liberators follow the path of the Elementalist or
Nethermancer and attempt to liberate trapped or bound spirits and elemental=
s.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Liberators don=
‚Äôt
usually care for a flashy show and usually refrain from the ways of the
Swordmaster or Troubadour. Liberators also have little use for Wizards, who
traditionally prefer study to action. While Disciplines like the Thief and =
Sky
Raider offer useful abilities, they don‚Äôt appeal as secondary Disciplines
because their attitudes often oppose the Liberator‚Äôs goal of helping othe=
rs.
Likewise, the bond shared between a Cavalryman and his mount makes this
Discipline unattractive to a Liberator adept.</p>

We do not trek through the wilderness for the sake of exploration, nor do we
flow among the citizenry for the sake of doing so. The means is most certai=

not the end. We may at times take pride in our ability to move and blend in
with the world, but this is not the point of it. We don‚Äôt travel just bec=
ause
the world is out there; just as that mountain over there is no more a reaso=
n in
itself to climb its slopes. There must be a purpose and direction in doing =
such
things or they do not serve the good of other Namegivers and the good of our
world. A higher calling is needed for many of my kind to leave their Lifero=

is a great honor among my kind; it is not something to be lightly pursued
however. For not all are destined to be Messengers. There are many ways to =
find
one‚Äôs aptitude for the Discipline‚Äôs tenets. Some begin carrying news fr=
om one Liferock
to another, others carrying the tales and legends of lost companions and
friends. A Messenger will look deep into the heart of other obsidimen around
him and seek those to instruct in the Way. When he finds one, the Messenger
will send the recruit with a request to another Messenger, wherever he might
be. The receiving Messenger will size up the recruit and send him onto anot=
her.
This continues until one of them sees that the recruit not only has the des=
ire,
but the drive to be a true Messenger. Then he teaches the recruit the Vow,
which the recruit spends his return trip mulling over. Once he recites the =
Vow
before his initial teacher he makes it his own, becoming one of us, for he =
has
shown his worthiness.</p>

trains us to center ourselves, to look deep into our hearts and know why we=

what we do, and through doing so refine and deepen our sense of purpose. Li=

Weaponsmith sharpening a blade, we sharpen our resolve. This requires perio=
ds
of intense meditation as much as it requires a deliberateness and forcefuln=
ess
of action. While it may seem counterproductive, and is a jest of those igno=
rant
of our true nature, this requires a solemn patience that is the opposite of
hurrying. We know not the trials that will face us, and to have one‚Äôs mind
unprepared can leave it to waver at the worst possible times. The importanc=

reveals itself in other ways as well. While the Scout opens himself to
everything around, there is risk in that. There is much to distract and rob
one‚Äôs attention. The Messenger does indeed open his senses and take in the
world, but holds onto the good and casts aside the bad. The irrelevant piec=
es
must be sifted out and discarded, so the good can be kept. I have learned m=

of the peoples of this land and taken in much of its beauty and its pain, b=

such things as these never rise to the same level as the principles of the =

and roads of this land. That is our passion, our quest: to spread knowledge=
 and
the power it holds, one missive at a time. Few of you hurried, distractible
races have the patience and focus to consistently deliver the most important
messages time and again. Such precious cargo requires one to have no regard=

other races I should add some information now, having explained how the
Messenger serves civilization, and helps to maintain it. In former times, we
Messengers were only found among obsidimen, and even today most followers of
this Discipline are members of my race. We developed the Discipline to make
communication between our Liferocks easier, as they tend to be far apart. B=
ut
as the other races spread their spheres of influence, they, too, had the ne=
ed
for communication over long distances, for couriers and Messengers. So we
taught them our ways, because civilization is not exclusive to our people, =

something that is shared between all Namegivers.</p>

 the
Book of Tomorrow to kaers throughout Barsaive. Much earlier, the elves of W=
yrm
Wood spread throughout Barsaive and formed many small communities. The trol=

differences and similarities between the Messengers of old and those of the

delivering a missive someone else gave him, today‚Äôs Messenger finds his m=

Namegivers. All Messengers, however, share some common traits. They are a c=
alm
and dedicated people, sometimes even stubborn‚Äîat least in accomplishing a=
 task.
A common saying is that all Messengers are obsidimen at heart.</p>

with you, a legend among my kind in fact, of the Messenger who bore the sec=

of defeating a dreadful Horror to a faraway land. This Horror waylaid him on
his journey, seeking to destroy the message and shore up its weakness. Litt=
le
did the wretched Horror know what it held. After an eternity of grueling
torture it finally tossed the near-dead obsidiman away, convinced he was br=
oken
and mad. The dying obsidiman began to drag himself away, even as the Horror
laughed on. Not long after, the same Horror met its end at the hand of the
heroes of that land, for the message was delivered even after so long. We h=
old
our secrets closer than all else. This is a picture of the trust we strive =
to
deserve, both to keep the message safe and to ensure its delivery whatever =

cost.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>This trust com=

in our dedication to truth as well. The messages we bear come with a trust =
to
the truth of them as well as their accuracy. Many a message I have outright
refused to deliver as I knew it to be false. As one grows in the ways of a =
Messenger,
one can sense such things: deceptions, misdirections, outright lies.
Misinformation is worse than none at all. The spreading of lies can bring o=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Messengers are=
 known
for their reliability and determination. They don‚Äôt give their word light=
ly,
but they usually live up to it no matter the cost. Messengers don‚Äôt make =
their
journeys in order to explore the world; they travel because they have to. S=
taying
focused and ‚Äòon target‚Äô means being in accord with this Discipline.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Messengers are=
n‚Äôt
loners, however, and enjoy the company of other Namegivers. Many Messengers
join merchant caravans or adventuring parties because traveling in groups is
the best method to avoid danger and direct conflict. Though Messengers can
fight, they usually avoid combat if possible.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>A talent crisi=
s is a
confusing experience for a Messenger. He generally feels cut off from the w=
orld
around him, becoming lost and disoriented. As usual, the exact triggers for=
 a
talent crisis vary with each adept‚Äôs personal vision, but common violatio=
ns
include the Messenger deviating from his planned route, or losing or failin=
g to
deliver a message.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>As a Deed of
Atonement, the Messenger usually finds a way to retrieve the missive and
deliver it at a later time. For example, an adept whose package was stolen =
in
an ork scorcher raid might devote himself to seeking the scorchers out and
retrieving the package.</p>

some
of the other Disciplines, Messenger advancement rituals are based on experi=

the adept advances through the Circles of the Discipline, the importance of=
 his

happens after the character has proven that he possesses that relentless de=

instructors often find their characters harder to judge. Often, though, ade=

The adept meditates on delivering his request to his chosen ghost master.
During the meditation, he lives through a journey, overcoming any and all
obstacles in the process. When the adept reaches the ghost master the ritual
proceeds as normal.</p>

Nethermancers use half-magic to recognize uses of nethermantic magic, diffe=

types of undead and spirits, and magical rituals‚Äîespecially blood magic
rituals. Nethermancers may also use half-magic to understand the effects of
different blood charms, as these are linked with Nethermancy. Nethermancers=
 may
make Perception-based Half-Magic Tests to produce blood charms (see the
Enchanting chapter in the Player‚Äôs Companion). A Nethermancer may use
half-magic to sense the presence of spirits within 30 yards (15 hexes) of h=
is
location. The Detection Difficulty for sensing a spirit is the spirit‚Äôs S=
pell
Defense (determined by the gamemaster). If the test succeeds, the Netherman=
cer
can sense the presence of the spirit can use spells, or talents such as Spi=
rit
Hold or Spirit Talk, to communicate And interact wit h the spirit. The
gamemaster may choose to make this Half-Magic Test on behalf of a Netherman=
cer
character at any time, as this innate sense is always active.</p>

the
worlds beyond our own, we are suspected of consorting with Horrors and trea=
ted
as pariahs. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Our
explorations serve only to protect our fellow Namegivers from the ravages of
the Horrors and their constructs, including the undead. Do the spells and
talents we wield carry a dark tang to them, a stench of the grave? Perhaps =
to
the clouded mind, to the Namegiver who gives credence only to his untutored
feelings and flees from the blandishments of reason. But any who care to th=

Nethermancers because they fear death, and Nethermancers are symbolically b=
ound
to the concept of death. But Nethermancers do not fear death, for we know it
intimately. We know that it is not an impassable barrier, a wall between
something that is good and something that is bad. Death is but a doorway, a
threshold into another way of being. Life is not superior to death, nor is
death superior to life. Both have their struggles, their pleasures, and the=
ir
terrors. Only a fool looks upon death as anything more than another phase in
the building of one‚Äôs legend. Sadly, the land of the living is awash in f=
ools
who forever dread their mortality. But mortality is as much a part of us as=
 our
eyes or our toes. Those who fear death fear themselves. And if we Netherman=
cers
are thought of as harshly mocking or haughty, it is only because others have
not accepted the inevitable fact of death as we have. For with acceptance, =
we
give up our fears. </p>

emotion worthy of a Nethermancer. The true follower of the path learns
discretion, certainly‚Äîwe are not known as a foolhardy group. But every da=
y we
contemplate the worst that can happen to us and accept its possibility. To
conquer fear is to gain power. Fear is something that is useful to us, when
found in others. The Nethermancer learns to foster fear, to manipulate it. =
If
your heart contains fear, we will grab hold of it and use it to lead you ab=
out
like a dog on a rope. And you shall deserve such treatment, for fear is the
hallmark of the inferior mind. You need not be a Nethermancer to conquer yo=
ur
fears. But in my experience, you must be able to see that life and death are
not separate things. They are different ends of the same path, separated by=
 no
more than a gentle stream.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>As I have ment=
ioned,
the superstitious and willfully ignorant associate my learned craft with de=
ath
and the undead. However, the Nethermancer concerns himself not so much with
life and with death, as with the spirit, or soul. All Nethermancer talents =
emanate
from an understanding of the spirit. And the majority of Nethermancer spells
work through the spirit, either the spirit of the spellcaster or of his tar=
get.
Granted, sometimes the spiritual aspect of a nethermantic spell like Shift =
Skin
may not be immediately apparent to the uninitiated. But it is my fervent ho=
pe
that by the end of your perusal of this document, you will at least begin to
understand the subtle spiritual resonances that accompany this and other
gruesome-seeming effects in the Nethermancer‚Äôs arsenal. Soon you will be =
able
to look upon the spontaneous wrenching and tearing of the epidermal surface
occasioned by the Shift Skin spell and think not, ‚ÄúHow thoroughly appalli=
ng!‚Äù
but, ‚ÄúAh, what a profound lesson in the metaphysics of the soul!‚Äù </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The metaphysic=
s of
the soul‚Äîthis is the Nethermancer‚Äôs field of expertise. You might then =
ask,
what is the soul? This, dear reader, is the question all Nethermancers spend
their lives seeking to answer. For the spirit is an elusive thing, one that
forever evades precise definition and explication. We grope tentatively tow=
ard
knowledge of it. This in itself should tell you something very important ab=
out
Nethermancers. Unlike other Disciplines I could name, Nethermancers do not
claim to possess definitive answers to the questions posed by existence. The
Nethermancer learns that all certainty is but self-delusion, for the most
important single element of any Namegiver‚Äôs being‚Äîhis spirit‚Äîremains =
an enigma.
It is not knowing the correct answers that really matters, for there is no
single truth. Rather, the superior being knows the correct questions and
strives to answer them, and that is more than enough.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>This is not to=
 say
that we are entirely ignorant about the spirit. Generation upon generation =
of
Nethermancers has examined its nature. Though many of the conclusions we ha=
ve
reached are altogether too subtle for a general audience to grasp, I will a=
ttempt
to elucidate a few of the general principles for you. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The spirit can=
 be
defined as the essential essence of a being. The spirit is connected to the
body, and provides its basic impetus, much as a fire engine provides the
impetus for the riverboats of my people. Without an engine, the boat does n=
ot
run. Without a spirit, thought and emotion end, and the body eventually die=
s.
The spirit is the vessel that contains a being‚Äôs identity, its Name, which
gives birth to all thoughts, memories, emotions. Though the body cannot tru=
ly
live on without a spirit (I‚Äôll touch upon apparent exceptions in due cour=
se),
the spirit almost always persists after the decease of the body, for the Tr=
ue
pattern of any Namegiver is connected more to the spirit than the physical
body. When the body dies, a severance occurs in the pattern, and a vestigial
fragment of the pattern remains connected to the corpse. However, the remai=
nder
of the True pattern persists with the spirit‚Äîor, as some claim, is the sp=
irit.
(The question of whether the True pattern and spirit are in fact one and the
same has raged among Nethermancers since legendary times. It is essentially=
 a
matter of semantics.) </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>At any rate, i=
t is
knowledge of spirits that enables us to understand and influence spirits‚Äî=
both
of the living and the unliving‚Äîthe ability that most strongly characteriz=
es the
Nethermancer. We must first of all understand our own spirits before we can=
 learn
to engage in dealings, consensual or otherwise, with other spirits,
discorporate or otherwise. A Nethermancer is therefore a contemplative
individual, one given to great introspection. Solitude is the Nethermancer‚=
Äôs
friend. Though I have met talkative and loquacious colleagues in my day, mo=
st
of us are quiet and restrained. Indeed, our fearsome reputation is quite at
odds with our sedate behavior, a fact which occasions many delightfully dro=
ll
comments at Nethermancer gatherings. The fact that we are considered sinist=
er
embitters some of us, but most of my colleagues are acute connoisseurs of
irony, and treat the absurd general dislike of our Discipline with sardonic
humor. I remember one interesting occasion when a windling spy was found
secreted in an empty ale barrel at a symposium of Nethermancers I attended =
in
Iopos. We were able to wring much amusement from a series of experiments
designed to acquaint the irritating interloper with‚Äîbut I digress. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Some have prop=

that an orderly determination of the migration of spirits after death once
existed. These individuals believe that the fate of a spirit can be predict=

based on certain observable factors concerning the being‚Äôs life. They bel=
ieve
that the souls of those who live virtuous lives travel to a variety of
different paradisiacal realms on the other side of astral space. Such realms
are described in great detail in early legends, though the accounts differ
greatly from one another. Needless to say, the definitions of virtue requir=
ed
for admittance vary just as widely from tale to tale. Some of my brethren t=
ake
these tales literally, claiming that all of these blissful afterlives truly
existed, in harmony with one another. The assignment of particular souls to
particular paradises depended upon the culture of a Namegiver‚Äôs birth, or=
 on
the Passion with whom the Namegiver chose to identify. Other Nethermancers
argue that these legends are unreliable as factual accounts and contend that
they refer to a single afterlife realm capable of altering itself to fit the
desires of each soul it contained. I have personally encountered evidence t=

also describe a similarly elaborate web of hells that awaited the souls of
those who had committed misdeeds in life. Again, Nethermancers differ as to
whether these actually existed in a vast jumble of separate realities, or if
the truth must be considered lost, transmuted to legend by the drift of mem=
ory
and fantasy. Yet a third theory may also explain the variety of hells in old
legends: this theory holds that these references describe the home realm of=
 the
Horrors themselves. This seems convincing to me. Perhaps those whose True
patterns became twisted by their own foul deeds came to mystically resemble=
 the
Horrors and were drawn to their realm after death. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>At any rate, t=

explanations now are of mere historical interest. At some point in history,=
 the
orderly transmission of souls to proper destinations was permanently disrup=

and remains so to this day. This may have happened during an earlier Scourg=
e,
or it may have happened when Death itself was buried beneath the volcanic f=
ury
of the sea that now bears his name. We can no longer predict where a
Namegiver‚Äôs soul will go when his body dies. Some spirits continue to wan=
der
Barsaive (and presumably other earthly regions) after the deaths of their
bodies. (Though they maintain only insubstantial forms, it is possible to
interact with them via the use of certain of our spells and talents.) These
souls may remain here for various reasons. Some wish to finish some task
uncompleted in life, from the building of a bridge to the guarding of an
ancient manuscript. Others may be unreconciled to the manner and timing of
their deaths and wish to exact vengeance on the living being they deem
responsible. Still others may simply be unaware of the fact that they‚Äôre =
dead;
not surprisingly, death can interfere with correct perception of one‚Äôs
circumstances. (Are you sure you didn‚Äôt meet with a fatal accident today?)

that they suffered their second, more infinitely painful deaths with
equanimity. For they knew that their sacrifice fulfilled a vital goal. And
their sacrifice gave meaning to their lives. Yes, I used the same tactic

pattern
behind, the part that connects the subject‚Äôs soul and mental faculties to=
 its
body and physical abilities. Various spells, Horror abilities, and magical
treasures can attach a spiritual pattern to this part to reanimate the dead.
Most often, the worker of the magic will be reattaching the being‚Äôs origi=

spiritual pattern. It is often the case that the crude force of the required
arcane energies warps and degrades the spiritual pattern. This is why most
cadaver men are but drooling engines of destruction; the fine details of th=

all manner of vile acts because we dare to investigate the very nature of t=

than one Nethermancer, on the whole our efforts have been a boon to all
Namegivers. We have learned advanced techniques for dampening the Karma

them where they stand. Yet we have received little credit for this from the

their food. They need these things to survive, as we need meat and bread. (=
The
question of how they survive in their own realm during times of low magic is
one that has puzzled Nethermancers for centuries.) They elicit these emotio=

in us in order to live, just as we grow crops or hunt for game. We feel no
guilt when we slaughter a thundra for its meat. Likewise, the Horror feels
nothing but appetite and anticipation when it marks a Namegiver and begins =

legend. The Horrors do what they do in order to feed. Yet when we strike ou=

one another, we do not necessarily need to do so to survive. We have killed=
 one
another in the name of kings, in the name of Passions, in the name of racial

mountain of bones, bones of the innocent, a mountain built by Namegivers as

 by
other youngsters during childhood, or been affected by the misfortunes of
parents unfairly suspected of consorting with Horrors. Some Nethermancers m=
ay
be members of racial or cultural minorities in their home villages and may =
have
suffered prejudice because of it. Others may simply have been different from
their peers for as long as they can remember; absorbed by death and decay a=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Of course, not=
 all
Nethermancers need have been outcasts in their early lives. Some may seek
vengeance against the Horrors, and believe that using the Horrors‚Äô own to=
ols
against them is the swiftest and surest path to victory. Others manage to h=
ide
their fascination with the dark matters of the Nethermancers‚Äô craft until=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Few Nethermanc=
ers
live quiet lives in ordinary villages. While most villages can boast at lea=
st
one adept to serve as an advisor, few wish to have an expert in death magic=
 act
as a mentor to their children. As a result, most would-be Nethermancers lea=
ve home
in search of masters to perform their initiation. This circumstance adds to
most Namegivers‚Äô dislike of Nethermancers; they fear these adepts will lu=
re
their sons and daughters away from them forever with dark promises of forbi=
dden
knowledge. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Not surprising=

these attitudes lead most Nethermancers to disdain the average Namegiver. T=

who do not show a healthy disrespect for the masses often learn it from the=
ir
masters, who couch their contempt in a sardonic, mocking laugh at things ot=

consider tragic, and display little compassion for any behavior they consid=

foolish. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Most Netherman=
cers
are masters of moral relativism, holding to few absolute rules of behavior.=
 The
Discipline teaches that knowledge itself is neither good nor evil; it can o=
nly
be put to good or evil uses. Nethermancers generally define ‚Äúgood‚Äù as a=
 long-term
result; since they view death as a change of state rather than a permanent =
end,
they generally give the possible deaths of Namegivers less weight than othe=
rs
might. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Because
Nethermancers are traditionally taught never to regret mistakes, only learn
from them, a Nethermancer who begins to doubt the worthiness of his actions=
 may
suffer a talent crisis. Much of the Nethermancer‚Äôs magic depends on his
self-assurance; guilty feelings may also create a mental block that makes it
harder to use his magic effectively. Because many Nethermancers view life a=
nd
death as different ends of the same road, mourning the dead may also cause a
talent crisis. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The most common
taboo for Nethermancers, however, is giving in to fear. The Discipline teac=

that fear is a tool; to be swayed by it is a shameful impediment to their o=

success. Nethermancers overcome by fear are likely to suffer talent crises
until they perform a Deed of Atonement, usually by confronting and defeating
the source of the fear. </p>

The ghost master ritual for Nethermancers has fewer requirements and special

 are
most proficient at it. Likewise, Nethermancers are more likely to become gh=
ost
masters after their death, and are very open to influence things in the lan=
d of
the living from beyond the grave without elaborate shows of will to find th=
em.
The ritual consists of a simple ritual summoning of the ghost master, but t=
he
adept must bargain with the ghost master or reason for his worthiness as if
seeking a living teacher, instead of being trained automatically. The ghost
master may provide a task for the adept to fulfill in the land of the livin=

recompense. </p>

Nethermancers are traditionally taught to seek knowledge in all forms, an

Unfortunately, Nethermancers often have trouble finding masters willing to
tutor them in secondary Disciplines because other adepts are as likely as t=

Nethermancers are attracted to the Weaponsmith Discipline because of the me=

Where a Horror‚Äôs corruption is malicious and with intent, Namegivers often
corrupt through ignorance: a farmer allowing his cattle to eat every blade =

grass, leaving none for other animals; a man cutting down all the trees of a

those without the means, so harmony can be restored. Food, water, and shelt=

harmonious balance of nature. If education and other aid does not sway a pe=

The answer is never simple. The way of the fist is an easy path, one I reli=

Äô
single vision of healing corrupted lands throughout the world does not often
let those who follow this path take on another Discipline. However, if a
Purifier were to acquire another Discipline it would only be because it som=
ehow
aided in bringing about an end to the corruption wrought by the Horrors. The
Disciplines best suited to this task are the Elementalist and the Shaman. W=
hile
a Purifier relies mainly on his physical prowess to overcome Horrors and
Namegivers corrupting the land, Elementalists and Shamans try to maintain t=
he
balance of nature and the elements by using their spells and conjuring spir=
its.
The Weaponsmith and Horror Stalker Disciplines are also common choices for a
second Discipline, because adepts of both are typically headstrong and never
back down.</p>

Wizard Disciplines are neutral to the Purifier; while they try to unravel t=

secrets of the world, and their knowledge helps to understand astral space =
and
corruption better, their theoretical approach is not as appealing to the ac=
tion-driven
nature of the Purifier. Purifiers have a particularly hard time adopting the
Illusionist and Troubadour Disciplines. The Illusionist relies on deception,
which is anathema for the Purifier, and the Troubadour Discipline requires a
love of performance that most Purifiers do not share.</p>

There is so much more to my Discipline than that. However frustrating it may

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>What misconcep=
tions?
Well, let me name some. First and foremost, that we are little more than
glorified trackers. What nonsense! Anyone can learn to track; there is no m=
agic
in it. Hunters of all sorts learn the basic skills. But does the ability to
follow tracks, spoor, and broken branches make one a Scout? It does not. Ot=
her
misconceptions? That because we share certain talents with Archers and Thie=
ves,
we practice those talents in the same way as those other Disciplines. Again=
, a
sad mistake, I assure you. In truth, all of our abilities‚Äîthose that lead=
 to us
being labeled ‚Äútrackers,‚Äù ‚ÄúArchers,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThieves‚Äù‚Äîspring fro=
m one, well, I
hesitate to class it as a ‚Äúskill,‚Äù a ‚Äútalent‚Äù or an ‚Äúability.‚Äù =
It is all of
these and so much more. Let me explain. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>To be a Scout =
means
to be one with the world. We‚ÄîI and my fellows‚Äîopen our senses to the wo=
rld
around us. All of our senses, and all of the world. That is the part of our
Discipline that non- Scouts never seem to understand. Think of a tracker fo=
r a
moment. The tracker follows his quarry through the woods and forests using =
his
eyes and, to a lesser degree, his ears. He sees broken branches, disturbed
foliage, footprints, and maybe the spoor of his quarry. Sometimes he can he=
ar
the passage of that quarry through the woods‚Äîthe cracking of a twig, even=
 the
creature‚Äôs breathing. This proud woodsman believes he has ‚Äúopened his s=
enses‚Äù
to the world around him. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Nonsense! From=
 a
Scout‚Äôs point of view, his perceptions are as limited as those of a child
peeking through a keyhole. Think on it: the tracker selects the senses and =
the
clues that he believes are important. He may notice broken branches, because
those clues are ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù for the task of tracking. Anything
‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù is ignored or discarded. (Please appreciate that I am n=
ot
demeaning the tracker. Not seriously, at least. By opening two senses, he is
more in tune with his world than most people, who stumble through the world
guided by one sense only ‚Ä¶ and even that is used imperfectly.) </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>But I digress.=
 How
does a true Scout react in the same situation? The Scout opens all his sens=
es,
not simply those he has selected as ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù to the situation, and=
 expands
his awareness to include everything around him. How can you know in advance=
 what
will and will not be important in a given situation, I ask you? The Scout s=
ees
the same things as the tracker, but he sees more. He sees the broken branch
ahead, but he also sees, beyond that, the change in coloration of the
undergrowth that indicates the ground is growing softer. He hears what migh=
t be
stealthy movement to his right, but he also hears‚Äîagain, to his right‚Äît=
he soft
murmur of the wind and the twittering of songbirds. He feels the stirring of
the air around him, and the faintest of vibrations through the springy grou=
nd
beneath his feet. He smells the sweet scent of flax flower fruit on the bre=
eze,
mixed with the sharp tang of human sweat. He chews a blade of grass he picks
from the ground at his feet, and tastes the bitterness of peat. The Scout o=
pens
himself up to the forest around him, and he becomes the forest. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>How are these
perceptions relevant? Think on it a moment. A broken branch implies his qua=
rry
is ahead of him, yet he knows that the ground softens ahead and to the righ=
t‚Äîin
fact, it becomes a peat bog, the grass stem tells him that. Will his quarry
risk becoming stuck in a bog? No‚Äîit will almost certainly turn to the lef=
t.
What of the noise to the right, then, the sound the tracker interpreted as
stealthy movement? The wind, no doubt, for the songbirds to his right would
surely have fallen silent with the passage of a large beast. The Scout also
knows that a human is in the vicinity‚Äîpossibly tracking the same quarry‚Ä=
îand
hence will be careful to identify his target before letting fly with his
weapon. Do you understand now? That is the difference between a Scout and a
simple tracker. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Can you imagin=
e the
sheer joy a Scout finds in this oneness with his surroundings? Only another
Scout can understand the joy‚Äîthe transcendence‚Äîof running or flying thr=
ough a
dappled woodland, passing as silently as a ghost, leaving no trace behind of
your passage. Practicing the Discipline of the Scout allows the adept to gr=
asp
the halcyon days of legend, when peace and tranquility lay upon the world. =
When
we walk in the forest, we are a part of it‚Äîas much as the trees that shel=
ter
us, and the birds that sing for us, and the animals that watch us without f=
ear.
So too are we a part of the rolling plains, or the harsh and rugged uplands=
, or
even the arid deserts. Wherever there is life, there we are at home. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>By opening our
senses to our environment, we Scouts accept the world around us. We do not =
try
to change it. We view it as it is and we work within the constraints this
places on us. The environment ‚Äúaccepts‚Äù a Scout, just as the Scout ‚Äúa=
ccepts‚Äù
the environment. Why? I know not why. Perhaps a sage or Wizard could tell y=
ou.
I only know that it is true. Because we are as one, the environment around =
us
reacts as though we belong wherever we are. Think on it. How else could a S=
cout
move silently through the wilderness, or through the alleys of a city, come=
 to
that? A woodsman or tracker might learn the art of parting branches so leav=
es
do not rustle, of treading lightly so no twigs break underfoot. But there is
more to moving silently than that. What good does it do to stir no twig if =
all
the birds and animals of the forest around you proclaim your presence‚Äîeit=
her
with their cries or with their silence? The best tracker or woodsman is sti=
ll
an interloper in the environment through which he passes, and the world kno=
ws
this. When a Scout moves silently, he is one with the world around him. He
senses the lay of the land, the interconnections between branches, the
direction of the wind. But more importantly, the world around him senses him
and accepts him as part of itself. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Adepts of one
specialty often look with some degree of scorn on those who follow the othe=

Infiltrators, for example, consider the environment chosen by explorers to =
be
woefully simplistic and infinitely less challenging than that in which they
themselves excel. (After all, these specialists would argue, Namegivers have
much the same instincts as the beasts of the wild‚Äîbut they also have inte=

and no small degree of suspicion and paranoia! To move unnoticed among
Namegivers, to them, offers a much greater challenge.) </p>

skilled in the use of melee weapons as a Warrior adept, while others can pu=
t an

at certain skills usually viewed as skills of other Disciplines? </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Though the out=
comes
of the use of these skills may appear the same as for other Disciplines, the
way a Scout uses them is very different, for the use of these skills stems =
from
the Scout‚Äôs world view. As I understand it‚Äîand any Warriors reading my =
words must
forgive my ignorance‚ÄîWarrior adepts excel at combat by learning forms and
styles of attack and honing their reactions and their instincts, until they=
 can
react to a foe‚Äôs move instinctively. Thief adepts learn to pick locks or =
disarm
traps by studying the mechanisms by which locks and traps function and
practicing specific techniques for defeating those mechanisms. Archer adepts
know how to understand the arrow, not merely shoot it. </p>

faced with such tasks‚Äîsingle combat, for example, or opening a locked doo=

approach it with a different mental outlook. As when we are moving silently
through the wilderness, we open our senses‚Äîall our senses‚Äîto the clues
presented to us. From these clues, we can build up a mental picture of the
strengths and weaknesses of the obstacle before us, whether it be a swordsm=
an
or a lock. When it comes time to act, we focus all our attention and energy=

the weaknesses we have detected. </p>

his
method of learning is quite natural and effective, many outside the path fa=
il
to understand it. They imagine that our instruction involves specific skills
and techniques‚Äî ‚Äùstealth,‚Äù for example, or perhaps ‚Äúspoor identific=
ation.‚Äù
Well, a Scout‚Äôs training may contain some of that. But the most important=
 facet
of training is helping the initiate develop the Scout‚Äôs world view, the a=
bility
to perceive unhampered by his unconscious limitations. In other words, to h=
elp
the initiate strip away his preconceived ideas of the world and ‚Äúsee‚Äù i=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Most Namegiver=
 races
emphasize sight over all other senses. The first thing that a would-be Scout
must learn is to eliminate this unnecessary reliance on a single sense. All
senses are of equal importance in the grand scheme. Certainly, on specific
occasions, one sense may offer the most vital information, but to focus
exclusively and invariably on one sense is to limit yourself severely. One =
of
the most important lessons I teach to initiates involves temporarily removi=
ng
their sense of sight. So many students I have led through the woods
blindfolded, forcing them to reach out with their other senses to avoid a
painful collision or a jarring tumble! </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The vast major=
ity of
the training I provide has the same goal‚Äî extending and broadening percep=
tion.
Unlike the training of a Swordmaster, for example, I often simply walk with=
 a
student through a new environment‚Äîthrough the forest, or in the mountains=
, or
in the midst of a bustling city‚Äîand help direct his attention and sharpen=
 his
focus with questions. Quite a contrast to the way most people envision a
Scout‚Äôs training, I am sure! </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Certainly, som=
etimes
I help a student work on specific, tangible skills. But such task-oriented
training can come only after the student has sufficiently extended his
perceptions. For teaching a student how to exploit the weakness in a
swordsman‚Äôs style before the student can accurately identify that
weakness‚Äîwell, there are less complicated forms of suicide, but few less =
sure. </p>

The very nature of the Scout Discipline requires this kind of mental and

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>A talent crisi=
s is a
particularly harrowing experience for a Scout. He generally feels cut off f=
rom
the world around him, as blind and deaf to subtle clues of his environment =
as
ordinary ‚Äústumblers.‚Äù As usual, the exact triggers for a talent crisis =
vary with
the adept‚Äôs personal vision, but common violations include the Scout fail=
ing to
‚Äútread lightly‚Äù on the world. As a Deed of Atonement, the Scout usually=
 finds a
way to set right any harm to the world he may have caused. For example, an
adept who has damaged land he has traveled through might devote himself to
repairing that damage. Alternatively, a Scout may set himself a particularly
challenging version of his Karma ritual‚Äîone that will require all of his =
skills
and abilities and involves great personal risk. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Many Scouts ar=
e part
of an exploratory organization during their early career, or act in
reconnaissance roles for militaries or their homeland tribes. Such
organizations offer formal ceremonies for advancement and easier access to
teachers, as long as the Scout‚Äôs Circle is still low. For Scouts outside =
of
such an organization, a higher Circle Scout (often the same one who trained=
 the
adept) sets the adept some task or challenge that will require him to
demonstrate his newly learned abilities. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Recruitment: I=
n the
course of their travels, Scouts often encounter or hear of young men and wo=
men
who have what it takes to enter the Discipline (these candidates may have
reputations as ‚Äúnatural woodsmen‚Äù or something similar). Scouts interes=
ted in
recruiting new students organize competitions in which the candidates must
follow the Scout through the wilderness. Any candidate who succeeds in
following the Scout‚Äôs trail can become a recruit, if he so wishes. Recrui=
ts
often work under a master‚Äôs tutelage for years before they reach First Ci=
rcle. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Novice (Circles
2‚Äì4): When their masters judge that adepts are ready to advance to these
Circles, they often invite the recruits to participate in elaborate
competitions that resemble a combination of a race and a scavenger hunt. Cl=
ues
leading from one checkpoint to the next along the course are concealed in
various ways, so that only those participants who are intensely aware of th=
eir
surroundings can reach the end. Higher-Circle Scouts observe these competit=
ions
and note those adepts who have mastered the talents required for advancemen=
t to
the next Circle. These competitions take place within towns and cities as o=
ften
as in the wilderness. </p>

5‚Äì8): The instructor of a Scout advancing to this level hides in some safe
haven‚Äîin the wilderness, in a town, or in a city‚Äîand takes steps to con=
ceal and
protect himself that are appropriate to the student adept‚Äôs level of trai=
ning (physical
traps, obstacles, or even hired guards). The prospective journeyman must fi=
nd
his instructor, infiltrate any defenses, and acquire something (a tangible
object, information available only through closely observing the instructor,
and so on) before making his escape. </p>

itual:
The adept meditates on his chosen ghost master. During the meditation, he s=
ees
a vision of a certain location, with sketchy details that he perceives using
several senses in addition to sight. The adept must travel to this location=
, overcoming
any and all obstacles in the process. When the adept reaches the site, the
ghost master appears and the ritual proceeds as normal. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Because the Sc=

Discipline requires abilities similar to those of Archers and Thieves, both
Disciplines are common secondary choices. The Cavalryman is another
complementary choice; it grants greater mobility, and expands the Scout‚Äôs
perceptions to include those of his bonded mount. Explorers often feel a
kinship with the natural world that draws them to the Beastmaster Disciplin=

perhaps the least common secondary Discipline. Most Scouts feel Swordmasters
tend to concentrate too much on standing out from the environment, instead =
of
blending in with it, and approach combat in far too self-absorbed a way. Sc=
outs
also tend to avoid the Illusionist Discipline, which alters reality rather =
than
accepting and embracing it, and the Nethermancer Discipline, which is too o=

concerned with the astral realms beyond. </p>

tribes do not even have leaders at all, except in desperate times of war or
other catastrophes. Others elect their leaders, and some are led by those w=

inherited their position. Depending on how strong other leaders are, the
authority of a Shaman varies in weight. But in contrast, the Shaman always
receives his position because of his abilities‚Äìthe gift of sharing a bond=
 with
nature. This gift doesn‚Äôt fall from the sky, however; it has to be earned=

long and arduous one.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The gift of the
Shaman usually manifests very early, often during adolescence. Shaman tutors
may discover this gift in a child displaying great understanding of, or just
fascination with, nature. Some potential Initiates manifest powers unique to
our Discipline. From the day of discovery, the Shaman takes the student und=
er
his wing, looking for further proof of the gift, educating him during the
process. As soon as the Shaman is convinced the student has the potential to
become an adept, he offers to initiate him. Becoming a Shaman‚Äôs apprentic=
e not
only means earning respect from the Shaman, but also from tribe, friends, a=
nd
family, which often serves as encouragement to follow the Shaman‚Äôs path
steadily‚Äî for it can be disturbing.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>It is difficul=

understand or appreciate that nature treats some of its creations harshly f=
or
the benefit of others, and then reverses these roles on a whim. Believe me,=
 all
this is for the best; the fire that burns down and kills the trees clears f=
ertile
ground for other plants. We love nature and all of its creations above
everything else, and yet we have to hunt the deer and pick the fruit from t=
he
living tree. Becoming a Shaman means discovering a world of contrasts. The =
role
of the master is to help his apprentice to understand and support the harmo=
ny
in all this, just like a master musician might help his student compose a
melody. Notes or creations of nature‚Äî both form something bigger if put
together. Understanding the parts means understanding the whole. Understand=

the whole helps with decision and action.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>At some point,=
 a
Shaman decides that he cannot teach his apprentice anything more. The
apprentice has to see more of the world, more of nature, and is sent on a
journey. This usually happens a few months after initiation. The apprentice
travels the land of his own will and decision, returning home from time to =
time
to share his experiences with his master. His abilities will grow, and
eventually he will return to take the place his tribe has reserved for him.
It‚Äôs important that the student travels as far as he can, so that he sees=
 all
nature has to offer. Even if he chooses to spend the remainder of his life =
in a
desert, he has to gain knowledge of the mountains and the forest and the se=

remain in tune with nature, respecting it in all its forms and placing the

Shaman seeking an apprentice watches for likely candidates in his tribe or =

his travels. When he finds a potential adept, the Shaman tests him in some =
way.
For example, a Shaman may invite the candidate to share the experience of
seeing or feeling a natural event or feature: a rainstorm, a surging river,=
 a
forest, or even a campfire. In the course of ordinary conversation, the ade=
pt
casually asks the candidate to describe what he sees. Candidates who answer
with unusual sensitivity undergo more obvious tests; the Shaman may summon a
nature spirit and ask the candidate to converse with it. If satisfied by the
candidate‚Äôs responses, the adept initiates the candidate.</p>

Nature spirits can only exist in environments personified by them‚Äîfor exa=

a lake spirit only exists within a lake, and a forest spirit only in a
forest‚Äîand each only holds power within its environment. A nature spirit =

It is possible to summon nature spirits of different types, however. For

continues for a half hour, then the Sky Raider stops, continuing to meditate
while his shield still resonates from the furious bashing. The Karma ritual
ends as soon as the sound from the last drumbeat dies away.</p>

Song: For 5 Strain, the adept can summon a fierce storm. The adept must be =

an operating airship and call out or sing into the sky for 1 minute. He must
then succeed at a Sky Weaving (20) Test. If successful, a severe storm forms
around the adept‚Äôs ship, stretching out to a radius of 1 mile around it. =
The
storm does not affect the adept‚Äôs ship and lasts for 1 hour, after which =

begins to dissipate naturally. During that hour, the adept may at any time =

The Test Result is compared to the Spell Defense of all hostile airships in=

area. Each ship whose Spell Defense is not higher takes Damage equal to a
Willpower Test, no Armor protects against this Damage. Singing the Lightning
Song only causes Strain the first time it is sung, not when sung during the

so many trolls become Sky Raiders, and why so many Sky Raiders are trolls.
Members of other races who turn to the Sky Raider Discipline share this
attitude. It is this world view that attracts them. It should come as no

other aspects of troll culture and incorporate them into our personal visio=

Honor is of great importance‚Äîof overwhelming importance, in fact‚Äîto Sky=

of any race, as it is to highland trolls. Personal honor‚Äîthat which the t=

important. While a highland troll will defend the kat‚Äôral of his clan or

en if
you think our main occupation is singing, just because we are called
Songsmiths. You are also mistaken if you think we sing to great extent, or =
that
we sing better than a regular elf. The world gave us our Name because the s=
ong
is the universal expression of art and beauty. Every Namegiver able to spea=
k is
able to sing, too; you do not need any tools to do it. Nor do you need pen =
and
paper; it is not necessary to be able to read or write at all. Likewise, yo=
u do
not need instruments or space for dancing; you do not even need to be able =
to
move. You do not need carving tools or brush and paint; you do not even need
hands. Singing is the form of art that the biggest number of Namegivers can
practice next to storytelling. Singing and storytelling are related anyway;
everything is. So if you cannot define us as singers, what is a Songsmith t=
hen?</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>We Songsmiths =
are
individuals who fill our lives with art. We do not only practice art; we
incorporate it into everything we do. It is hard to explain, indeed, so let=
 me
tell you that the path of the Songsmith is often the second one we choose.
Whether adepts or not, most of us have done something else before we heard =
the
call of the Songsmith. I was a cabinetmaker, or common joiner, before I hea=
rd
my call. I created furniture for a living, but with time I realized I wante=
d to
make it more beautiful, more sophisticated. Simply put, I looked for new
challenges, and I found them in improving the abilities I already had. It w=
as
then I heard the call of the Songsmith.</p>

end of
mine, was a Swordmaster adept before she became a Songsmith. While walking =
her
path, she discovered that she preferred to integrate her combat moves into a
dance. Practicing the sword dance more and more, she eventually approached =
the
path of the Songsmith.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>I hope this
clarifies that there are not any ‚Äòpure‚Äô Songsmiths. The Songsmith is an
individual refined from another profession or interest. In other words, the
Songsmith makes common things more beautiful. Because of that, we are all v=
ery
different in occupation and thinking, but alike at heart and in spirit. Let=
 me
tell you where we are different first, for it might help you see the things=
 we
have in common.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>We create work=
s of
great renown. Non-elves probably won‚Äôt know about the different forms of =
art or
what art form is typical for a Songsmith. Well, in short: anything‚Äîit‚Äôs=
 up to
individual taste and talent. We always learn several forms, though, because=
 all
of them are related to each other. A common example, and the easiest one to
grasp, is the poem. Given the right melody and rhythm, you can also sing and
maybe even dance to it. And so on.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The Performer =
is the
most common Songsmith, focusing on arts of entertainment like singing, danc=
ing,
acting, and of course playing instruments. Performers often work together a=
mong
themselves or with other artists and adepts like Troubadours or Illusionist=
s to
create their performances. Some Performers even focus on directing the effo=
rts
of other Namegivers, creating a grand composition. However, these performan=
ces
seldom get as inappropriately pompous as those of the non-elf races.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Craftsmen Song=
smiths
focus on producing genuine items. These can be anything, from adornments for
one‚Äôs self or one‚Äôs household, to furnishing, to common items like clot=
hing,
pots, or weapons. The difference between a regular craftsman and a Craftsma=
n Songsmith
is that the latter cares much more for the beauty and elegance of the items=
 he
crafts. While a regular table will be a plain and functional item, a table
created by a Songsmith will be a marvel of carvings, careful painting, and
perhaps featuring an uncommon shape or matching centerpiece. Craftsmen
Songsmiths either learn arts that fit together for working on a common
material, like the weaving, dyeing, tailoring, and embroidery of clothes, or
they spread their choices wide to create many different items that fit a co=
mmon
theme, such as clothing, arms, and armor bearing the same ornaments.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Poet Songsmith=
s call
the written word their domain. They not only write poems, but everything el=
se
imaginable, as long as it is written art. They are playwrights and even
creators of songs, but in contrast to the Performer they do not consider
singing the most important part. Their joy is in the writing, which they
consider art for eternity. Many never sing their songs at all. The same app=
lies
for music, which some are eager to compose, but not to play. They experience
their art in their minds, upon creation. Some few Poet Songsmiths specializ=
e in
arts that do not seem as such in the first place‚Äîwriting letters, for exa=
mple,
or even legal texts and contracts.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>I am a Sculptor
Songsmith. As with the other groups, Sculptors do more than our Name sugges=
ts.
Sculptors differ from the Craftsmen in that our art is only for adornment a=
nd
education. This includes sculpting, but also painting, tattooing, and
body-painting. This is a short list in comparison, but one has to consider =
that
there are hundreds of forms of sculpting‚Äîbecause this art form includes
modeling and carving every material imaginable. On the other hand, we have =
much
in common with the Craftsman where jewelry and the like are concerned, and =
many
of us call ourselves Craftsmen because of that.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>There are, of
course, Songsmiths that do not fall into one of these four categories, or t=
hat
do not want to. Some, when they have mastered one form, learn the next one =
that
fits their mood. Others intentionally learn a diversity of arts because they
are convinced that only by mastery of many different forms is one a true
Songsmith. The forms of art a Songsmith learns may also depend on the path =
he
walks on the Wheel of Life, and some change their roles when walking on
different paths. The Performer and the Sculptor are most often chosen on the
paths that open themselves to the world, while the Craftsman and the Poet f=
ocus
on one‚Äôs self. You see why I call myself a Sculptor instead of a Craftsma=
n?
Because I began to walk on the Path of the Traveler when I heard the call of
beauty.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>As I told you
before, while we all are different from an outside perspective, we are alik=
e in
our hearts. You will notice that though we all practice our art in a differ=
ent
form, we share a common goal: creating beauty. By that, we not only fill our
own lives with joy, but those of others, too. Our greatest reward is the
sparkle in the eyes of the person receiving one of our works, realizing tha=
t it
is not just a tool or other needed thing, but also something that wakes the
appreciation of beauty common to all elves and many other Namegivers. Howev=
er,
we do not like those who display our works as just another symbol of their
status or wealth. The love for beauty is something pure, something true that
lies in one‚Äôs heart, and should not be corrupted by the overly pronounced=
 ego
of a weak spirit.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Now I expect t=
he
reader to ask if we should be the ones judging such behavior, or drawing a
border between good and bad appreciation, if there is any such thing. It is=
 not
easy for me telling you this, but since it is a great shame and heavy on the
heart of our Discipline, I will tell you of the past, so many can learn for=
 the
future.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>In the past, m=
any
Songsmiths thought it fitting to judge right from wrong in the matter of ar=
t,
because who if not them could understand it? It was not entirely their faul=
t;
they were lured into this by a power that wanted to profit from their works:
the elven queen. The queen and her court defined all of elven culture by the
lifestyle of their small community, and they needed tools to carry it to the
rest of the world. The Songsmiths acted as the ears and the mouths of queen=
 and
court, while adepts of other Disciplines were her eyes and hands. The queen=
‚Äôs
mouths delivered her messages, both as couriers carrying news and laws from
Wyrm Wood and as the ones displaying Wyrm Wood‚Äôs culture, leading the way=
 by
example. The queen‚Äôs ears heard elves in distant places speak their opini=
ons of
her rule, and they observed how elves practiced their arts and judged if th=
ey
did so in an acceptable way. Acceptable to the queen, that is.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Our Discipline=
 was
ideally suited to fulfill these tasks, because we unite both performance and
communication. We could deliver good and bad news, gossip, and the court‚Äôs
culture equally well, being the friendly face of distant Wyrm Wood. Our many
professions enabled us to judge the many forms of art the elven settlements
practiced, even in the adornment of simple items. Our wandering nature prov=
ided
the ideal excuse to come and go, and we were welcome everywhere. Only too l=
ate
did we discover that we were the tools in a hand enslaving everyone‚Äôs min=
ds, so
unbefitting our free spirits and those of others. We, who praised individua=
lity
above all through our art and conviction! It sounds like a joke, but to the
Songsmiths of the present, it is a bitter one.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>We learned fro=
m our
mistakes. It is unknown whether we discovered a new path, or if we began to
walk old ones again, but today we know that strength and beauty are found in
variety, the variety of many styles by individual artists. Conformity is a
corruption of elven culture, of every culture. You can see that in the Blood
Wood, where Songsmiths still act as agents of the queen. The blood elves‚Äô
reluctance to free themselves from their thorns, perhaps even against the w=
ill
of the queen, stems from their cultural stagnation to no small extent. They
were taught to accept. Accepting the court‚Äôs culture was merely a first s=
tep,
but now they accept every fate the queen has decided upon. So if I can tell=
 you
anything else about modern-day Songsmiths, it is that many criticize the
corruption of elven culture the Blood Wood practices. I cannot speak for all
Songsmiths, what with all I have told you about individuality, now can I?</=

Songsmith serves a purpose in the fight for true elven culture, whether he

themselves equally with everything from the smallest details of appearance =

world continually draw our attention to opportunities for saving a life or
puncturing the so-called wit of a bore lacking his fair share of manners.
Likewise, when faced with a dramatic situation in which our presence might

first set eyes on young Captain Fettalan, with his dark cloak and iridescent
green scales ‚Ä¶ what adventures can begin with a single sweep of the tail!=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>But before I g=
et
carried away in that Tale of a Tail (and I must admit that Captain Fettalan,
who is an excellent Troubadour, tells it far better than I), I should remark
that it is a measure of the Swordmaster‚Äôs perspicacity, our keen percepti=
on,
that enables us to identify injustices that others might not so easily
recognize. True, some disgruntled souls claim that we create dramatic
situations from thin air, but they would not‚Äîand could not‚Äîclaim such b=
eliefs
if those unfortunate ones could even brief ly see the world through our eye=

For those of you who sadly lack the required skills of heart, mind and body=

once we witness an injustice as we are to recognize such a need in the first
place! </p>

time learning and rehearsing the dance. The physical, mental, and emotional
skills required of a Swordmaster are such that daily practice is a necessit=

that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, and Swordmasters who favor
this style of training take this saying to heart. An adept trained in this
manner learns his Discipline by imitating the verbal and physical stylings =

his master. The recruit must learn to successfully imitate everything about=
 his
teacher, from how to dress and turn a phrase, to the type of sword and the
parry-thrust combinations his master favors. Adepts trained in this manner =

training may well be the most common of all forms. Here, recruits are taugh=

use their budding skills as a foil on which their master can build. The
apprentice becomes the master‚Äôs constant companion and uses his master‚Äô=
s verbal
cues and physical ripostes as pegs on which to hang his own skills of word =
and
weapon. Likewise, he learns to provide openings that allow his teacher to w=

his own skills more admirably. The foil style of training often produces ad=
epts
with skills and habits reminiscent of, but still distinct from, their maste=

oach
of the basic training styles is undoubtedly the least common. Swordmasters =
who
favor the contention training style tend to be stern teachers, punishing
students who make errors with harsh behavior. Though this style is frowned =
on
by some Swordmasters as stunting the vigor of recruits, it has been known to
produce some very impressive young Swordmasters. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>In the content=
ion
style of training, the master continually challenges his pupil. The Swordma=
ster
goes over a skill a few times or, in some instances, simply tells the recru=
it
to learn it. Just when the apprentice believes he is getting a handle on th=
e skill
or idea, the master challenges him in the most brutal way possible. Has the
recruit just learned a new leap and parry combination? Why then, the master
leaps at the pupil, sword in hand, just as the poor apprentice is finishing
supper. Has the recruit recently begun to show a more biting wit? If so, he
will undoubtedly soon be recovering from a blazing string of scathing insul=
ts.
Though this method may seem harsh, certain apprentices thrive on the consta=

challenge, their anger and fear only tempering their resolve to become
full-fledged Swordmasters.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>On hills and in
dales, along riverbanks and in town commons, Swordmasters regularly hold
loosely organized tournaments. (A tournament must have at least nine
competitors to qualify as a tournament, and not merely a challenge.) At lea=
st a
dozen specific tournaments take place each year in Barsaive, the largest and
most famous being the Grand Tourney, held at midsummer just outside of
Bartertown. Swordmasters from across the continent travel to Bartertown each
summer to compete in the various contests held at this most prestigious eve=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Tournaments of=
fer
Swordmasters a number of different opportunities. Perhaps most importantly,
tournaments provide a place where adepts can meet with others who share our
unique view of the world. The vast majority of Swordmasters are garrulous,
social beings who adore being the center of attention. One must rarely wait
more than an hour into a tournament before witnessing the first extravagant
stories and daring leaps from balconies. Tournaments are often spectacular =
fun
for other Namegivers observing the competition, but be warned! It is all too
easy to be caught up in any one of a number of unofficial contests of all t=
ypes
which we Swordmasters use to continually test ourselves and each other. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Official event=
s at
tournaments usually include a few swordless competitions testing agility (l=
ong
and high jumps) and wit (challenges of repartee), but most events revolve
around sword fights that test all the Swordmasters‚Äô skills. These events
fulfill the second major purpose of tournaments by enabling Swordmasters to
rise through the Circles of the Discipline. Save for those lucky enough to =
find
a ghost master, almost all Swordmaster adepts rise in Circles in this manne=
r. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Rising through=
 the
lower ranks of Circles merely requires that the adept display proficiency in
the proper skills over the course of the tournament. Reaching the upper Cir=
cles
requires the adept to overcome far greater difficulties. In these cases, th=
e Swordmaster
must prove himself capable of defeating multiple opponents of his current
Circle in dramatic combat. Often, the adept begins the contest at some sort=
 of
a disadvantage (for example, having one hand tied behind his back) or with =
an
additional task (rescuing a ‚Äúcaptive‚Äù) he must accomplish during the fi=
ght.
When attempting to attain the very highest Circles, the odds against a sing=
le
candidate can be truly overwhelming. I had the great good fortune to witness
the troll Swordmaster, Aldaric the Unbowed, successfully defeat eighty
opponents in the course of a single battle to reach the Ninth Circle. And
Aldaric began the competition at the bottom of a well! </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Unfortunately =
for
our Discipline, favoritism sometimes creeps into tournaments to give unfair
advantage to Swordmasters attempting to reach the higher Circles. Ideally, a
Swordmaster of Fifth Circle or higher should be truly brilliant with his
weapon, regardless of the other skills he possesses. Still, the more
influential masters who decide close matches occasionally allow less physic=
ally
adept, but more popular, swordsmen to advance to higher Circles without
obtaining the proper level of skill. Ah, well, I suppose it is not surprisi=
ng
that such favoritism occurs in a Discipline so full of vainglorious sods as
ours. </p>

its own peculiar traditions and customs. However, I have never heard of a
tournament that does not bestow bragging rights on one of its contestants.
Quite simply, whomever the tournament judges deem to have performed the sin=

most memorable accomplishment at the tournament that year wins the tourname=

bragging rights. The action need not occur during the course of an official
contest, though it most often does. For example, the right witticism delive=
red
with impeccable timing at the inn has been known to win bragging rights for=
 the
swordsman who spoke it. A Swordmaster with bragging rights gains a certain
amount of esteem from any adepts who participated in the tournament.
Additionally, etiquette demands that an adept who holds bragging rights be
allowed first stab at a quest or task or in the event that a dispute occurs
between two adepts. Bragging rights last until the next time that tournamen=
t is
held. Of course, the larger and more prestigious the tournament, the greate=

the Grand Tourney is the most prestigious!) </p>

Swordmasters resemble the glamorous swashbucklers of song and story. Unlike=
 a
Warrior, a Swordmaster does not focus on simply defeating the enemy; it is =
in
the act of fighting that he embodies his Discipline. Killing is not the main
goal of battle; it is merely one possible outcome. The Swordmaster need not
risk his life foolishly, but should attempt to fight his battles with panac=
he.
A Swordmaster who deliberately prolongs a battle in order to make it more
exciting and beautiful is acting in accordance with his Discipline. Battle =
is
his art, and he practices it with joy. </p>

Swordmaster is comfortable with both his body and his mind, and he almost n=

sits quietly in the background. Clever catch phrases, witty insults, and
humorous asides are as natural to him as the elegant embellishments of his
swordplay. Players who wish to play the glib swashbuckler but have difficul=
ty
coming up with the proper ‚Äúzinger‚Äù on the spur of the moment can find
inspiration from adventure films of the 1940‚Äôs and 1950‚Äôs and any seria=

sual

believe the simplest way to get from point A to point B is a straight line,=

the Swordmaster adamantly denies this notion. To the Swordmaster, how an ac=

licity
and straightforwardness are alien values to this Discipline; flair, eleganc=

versatile fifth limb, allowing me to multitask like none of the other races
can, whether in dancing, combat, swimming, or even doing routine daily task=

The most powerful Taildancers have learned how to improve the use of the ta=

attaching these limbs to their backs, attempting to gain a fifth limb. This=

not an extra arm, leg, or even a tail at all. It lacks the true feelings of

parry with. Both styles are usually taught to Swordmasters and Warriors, as
these are quite easy to learn. Taildancer initiates tend to pick up the Sko=

style since its use helps in protecting the tail from injury. The Edo style,
which focuses on using the tail‚Äôs natural flexibility and reach with unar=

dancing and struggling with challenges. Finally, kyapaas teaches us the need
for balance between personal ambition and loyalty. Thus all Taildanc- ers f=

and dance as much for the protection of their houses as for themselves. By

 Like
the Swordmaster, a Taildancer will often perform a spectacular maneuver more
for showmanship than for its effectiveness in defeating an opponent. Unlike
Swordmasters, Taildancers usually want their opponents to look good as well=
, so
they often ham it up when their opponent gains an advantage, acting more hu=
rt
by an opponent‚Äôs blows than they actually are, or trying to fall with sty=
le
when knocked down. Some even go so far as flopping to the ground after being

remain true to the taildance; they risk suffering talent crisis if they sway
from its calling. A Taildancer not using his tail in favor for other weapon=
s in
combat may invoke a talent crisis, but if the Taildancer had lost his tail =
due
to trauma and is in the process of growing it back the use of another melee
weapon will not constitute a violation. However, only using a hand-held mel=
ee
weapon while the Taildancer has a fully functional tail can invoke a Severe
violation. Followers of the Edo school risk suffering a talent crisis should
they attach weapons or armor to their tails.</p>

take on additional Disciplines since this would take away time from training
with their tails. However, when they do choose another Discipline, they usu=
ally
combine the taildance with the way of the Elementalist, Illusionist, Trouba=
dour,
or the Scout. Those who become Elementalists often specialize in the elemen=
t of
air, and use this mastery of the air element to create unique types of danc=
es.
The Illusionist and Troubadour Disciplines appeal to the Taildancers‚Äô lov=
e of
performance, allowing them to greatly enhance their acting in combat, and u=
se
illusion spells to make their dances more aesthetically pleasing. The enhan=
ced
perceptions of the Scout allow Taildancers to greatly enhance the sense of
touch of their tails and perceive the world in a different way.</p>

and
the Swordmaster does not care who the opponent is, often embellishing fights
and deeds against weaker foes, fights the Taildancer would likely just igno=
re.
For the Taildancer, there is no competition or challenge in fighting a weak=
er
foe. The same is true of the Taildancer‚Äôs opinion of the Warrior Discipli=
ne,
although the outlook of the Warrior tends to be too pragmatic for the

e.
Thus it is rare for a Taildancer to ever choose the path of the Air Sailor,
Boatman, Cavalryman, or Sky Raider. The Taildancer‚Äôs love of performance =
means
that Disciplines like the Nethermancer, Thief, Weaponsmith, and Wizard, the
followers of which spend life in the shadows, toiling in forges, or buried =
in
books, spend too much time away from the stage to be of interest to him.</p>

perhaps the most absurd untruth contends that Thieves lead sad and lonely
lives, deprived by their Discipline of the companionship of others. What
foolishness! Why, I could stack my friends and allies up against those of a=

other Namegiver and not come up wanting, I assure you. Yes, it is true that
those Thieves who follow the path of selfishness‚Äîof which I shall speak
more‚Äîshield themselves from the love of others and draw strength from the=
ir
solitude. But many more of us are as gregarious as a whushah fly in blooming
season‚Äîand most delightful company, as you surely must agree! We are fully
capable of sustaining profitable alliances with others, of keeping our word,
and of tying our vital threads to Namegivers we love and esteem. I myself h=
ave

lives to steal, does not mean she must steal from everyone. Myself, I prefe=

steal from the too-haughty Therans, from drooling Horrors and their corrupt
servants, and from the long dead, who shall scarcely miss their coins and j=

And, of course, from those in great spiritual need of the gift of theft. </=

the urge to steal the hard-won silver of my comrades as can a Warrior resist
the urge to stab his brother, or a Wizard refrain from casting a mind-rippi=

Thieves are not stupid. Not the live ones, anyway. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>It is true tha=
t some
adventuring bands are reluctant to recruit Thieves as companions. This is t=
heir
great loss. For the way of the Thief provides many abilities beyond the mere
lifting of purses and pilfering of coppers, abilities that have proved vita=
l to
many a legendary endeavor. Think on it. What good is finding a chest inside=
 a
deep and musty kaer if there is no one to seduce its lock, to steal into the
heart of the mechanism and coax it open? And what adventuring band has never
needed someone to stalk soundlessly into an enemy camp for an unnoted
reconnoiter? What crime is it to steal from a hidden, ancient blade the sec=
ret
of its location and spare one‚Äôs comrades from its thirst for blood? And h=
ow
often do activities of adventurers lead them into intrigue and the machinat=
ions
of the powerful? In such situations, can one begrudge the Thief her ability=
 to
don the garb of others and rob the foe of treasured confidences? And the
usefulness of an unexpected dagger thrust between the shoulder blades of a
vengeful Nethermancer should be beyond question to any thinking adventurer.
Yes, the Thief is to be coveted as an ally: better to draw us to your bosom
than cast us out. Unless, course, you wish us to feel justified in liberati=

your goods from you. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Likewise, the =

Thief values the abilities of trusted associates more than any purloined
bauble. I can swing a scabbard with more than passable facility, but prefer=
 to
leave such matters up to the true experts, Warriors and Swordmasters. Likew=

I am glad to have spellcasters to rely upon when magical obstacles obscure =

Weaponsmith or Troubadour, a Thief is not wise to announce her Discipline to
all who approach, for outside of Kratas few villages welcome Thieves. And so
finding a mentor becomes the first test of the would-be Thief. He must be
perceptive enough to spot a true Thief when she passes through his field of

the Thief is not a mere intellectual matter, a series of puzzles to be solv=

practiced in the field. And the true initiation of a Thief takes place in t=

target greatly in need of the gift of theft. If the student is truly Thief

them arises. If the student is not‚Äîwell, capture is one of the hazards th=

Picking a pocket is not a team effort, for one cat walks more quietly than

They believe that a Thief can only prosper through suspicion of others and =

cooperation and compassion weakens their talents and renders them vulnerabl=

To me, stealing something the owner values too much is an act of charity, a

lar
joy in stealing from my misguided brethren‚Äîshe mourns for it as anyone el=

pours her love into gold and gemstones. Though booty cannot keep one warm at

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Solitary Thiev=
es
most often take up the Archer, Nethermancer or Warrior Disciplines as a sec=
ond
adept‚Äôs way. The way of the Warrior appeals to these Thieves as the simpl=
est
way to beef up their fighting prowess. The Archer Discipline also gives them
fighting ability, though solitary Thieves who become Archers often turn to =
the
sniper‚Äôs path (see the On the Path of the Archer chapter, p. 20). Seeing =
the
world as their enemy, they give in to the lure of the sniper‚Äôs arrow and =
become
the brigands and roadway ambushers who pick off targets from a distance and
then loot the corpses. The solitary Thief often feels a strong kinship with=
 the
Nethermancer‚Äôs way because practitioners of both Disciplines are seen by =
others
(and often themselves) as dark and dangerous outcasts. Also, Nethermancers
break the taboos surrounding death and the Horrors just as Thieves break mo=
re
ordinary laws. </p>

performing the odd bit of research, going off into the wild requires suppli=

substantial amounts of coin, more than the average Traveled Scholar is like=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Sometimes an
expedition is not required. The Traveled Scholar may journey by himself, or
with just a few trusted companions, who either take care of their own expen=
ses,
or are not expensive in and of themselves. In my case, I have journeyed this
way for much of my life, seeing the world with only my two guards, Renaldo =
and
Urgruk, by my side. Sturdy men of simple tastes, I have prized their company
for their interest in seeing my work done, and their willingness to accept a
slightly lower standard of living than the usual mercenary guard. I am a ma=
n of
simple tastes myself, much more likely to take my noon meal from a street
vendor than at a wineshop, and content with journeybread, dried meat, and w=

and parcel of being a Traveled Scholar. One must be sturdy, able to travel =
on
foot for great distances and to endure with little food and a heavy pack. O=
ne
must be determined, to see one‚Äôs work through when faced with seemingly
insurmountable obstacles. One must be able to get by on little or no coin,
being resourceful enough to survive on what can be found or worked for along
the way. And above all else, one must be reliable, able to deliver what has
been promised no matter the personal cost. I have known Traveled Scholars w=
ho
have returned from afield with limbs missing, sick from hunger and thirst, =
most
of their equipment and sometimes their entire worldly possessions lost, but
with their notes still intact, able to deliver their results and make one m=
ore
addition to the world‚Äôs stockpile of knowledge. Perhaps this is why only =
dwarfs
follow the Discipline. We are the only race stubborn enough to endure what =
we
endure, for a prize that cannot be easily held in the hand, and whose worth

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>What measures =
our
value, and the value of what we have done, is respect. It is enough for us =
to
be held in high esteem by our colleagues. All of the awards, the ribbons and
medals, the coin and jewels; all pales into insignificance when compared to=
 the
applause of one‚Äôs peers at the end of a presentation. The acclaim of the =
public
is a grand and glorious thing. The acclaim of the academic world is greater=
. To
be judged a great man by the populace, and set on high, can be embarrassing,
and can even interfere with our studies, when the duties of high position
prevent us from haring off after an idea. Our fellow scholars, however,
understand what is truly important. They know that the quest for knowledge =
must
always take precedence, even over our personal lives, our relationships, and
our lives themselves. The respect accorded us from those who truly understa=

a paper
not your own without giving proper credit is a heinous crime. Turning back =
from
a journey before the goal is achieved is shameful‚Äîa sign of personal weak=
ness
that puts your Discipline itself in doubt. Pursuing an idea deemed heretica=
l,
unfounded, or ridiculous is done only when driven by the greatest of person=
al
conviction, when the Traveled Scholar is possessed of unique knowledge that
convinces him that the popular view held by his colleagues is without a dou=

himself right. This is the one area where we exercise the most caution in o=

willing to put themselves on the line once and for all in order to seek a h=

truth. This level of risk, however, requires substantial consideration. Many
Traveled Scholars have retired from their journeys, taking up sinecures as
librarians and private researchers, ending their lives scribbling repetitive
monographs on their earlier adventures, rather than confront such a risk. T=
hose
few who have taken the risk have either met with appalling doom, or been
acclaimed by the greatest of heroes of our race. Their Names have been
remembered, either as terrific fools or with the highest of honor. And all =

spectacular that they should pay you to write them down. It‚Äôs no wonder t=
hat
Traveled Scholars and other academics have such strong conflicts with each
other, and are so well known for being stubborn and intransigent. This
stubbornness, however, is necessary to keep us at our task. The personal
conviction that we are right in our beliefs, that we have the answers, that=
 we
can indeed say it better than anyone else, is what keeps us at our desks,
scribbling away into the small hours.</p>

critique. We submit our work to review committees, and revise yet again bas=

out whether or not it was all worth anything. Imagine the crushing defeat
suffered by a Traveled Scholar who has spent five years in the field doing
research and another year writing his paper, only to present it to laughter=

spend our every waking hour thinking about it, writing, crossing out, writi=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>A Traveled Sch=

risks talent crises when passing up a chance to learn something new. This w=
ill
range from Minor all the way up to Heinous, depending on how rare and fragi=
le
the opportunity is. Deciding to go for an ale instead of attending a schola=
r‚Äôs
presentation on hach‚Äôvar, only the third presentation on that subject this
week, is a Minor violation at best. Refusing to go see the night-blooming
bloodflower of Cravic Peak, which only blossoms once every twenty years, and
then only if there‚Äôs a full moon on the proper night, would be a Heinous
violation.</p>

in an attempt to find the original item or event or place, is not a violati=
on.
If it were, Traveled Scholars couldn‚Äôt use maps. Likewise, failing to pro=
vide
information when it‚Äôs asked for constitutes a violation. Demanding recomp=
ense
for information that‚Äôs hard to come by does not. If someone wants to know=
 a
secret that took you five years to learn, and cost you three friends into t=
he
bargain, it‚Äôs only fair that they should offer a substantial amount of go=
ld in
return. On the other hand, a Traveled Scholar would never charge for direct=

the
rebuilding of Barsaive‚Äîand, for that matter, a part of anything that is
considered noteworthy in our world. The Warrior in my little tale was right=
 to
some degree, of course. The value of a hero is not measured solely by his o=
wn
feats and achievements. Important though they may be, they are perforce
limited, for even the greatest hero can be in only one place at a time. So =
how
else do we mark the measure of a hero? By his effect on others‚Äîon those w=
ho
follow him and strive to mimic the ideal he represents. Some of those who
follow in the hero‚Äôs footsteps may become heroes in their own right, and =
others
will follow them in turn. And so the effects of the hero‚Äôs deeds spread, =

the branching boughs of a great tree. And from the seed of the hero‚Äôs dee=

a hero‚Äôs fame. We nurture and spread his legend, just as the wind carries=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>There are two =
facets
to the Discipline of the Troubadour‚Äîapparently distinct, yet interconnect=
ed.
The first facet is the face we most often show to the world‚Äîthe face of t=
he
entertainer. In this guise, we offer diversion. We help people forget their
troubles and bring joy, relief and release. Living in our world is hard, bo=
th
on the body and on the soul. And just as the body needs rest after a day of
work, so does the soul need relief. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>That relief ca=
n be
found in a light tale, a bawdy song, a ditty of nonsense words that brings a
smile and a laugh to those who hear it. Many ordinary folk consider this re=
lief
the greatest gift that those of my Discipline can bestow. My fellow Troubad=
ours
and I know differently, for entertainment is more than laughter. Relief and
release for the soul can be found in emotions other than joy and
lightheartedness. That is why we of the word and the melody recall dark tal=
es
as well, tales that evoke sadness, fear, anger. These other emotions we
deliver, as we deliver joy. There is heart-ease in laughter, but also in te=
ars.
And heart-ease is the goal of entertainment, whether that entertainment be
tragedy or comedy. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>I have heard it
argued that, when the world turns dark and doom stalks our footsteps,
entertainment is valueless, frivolous. Only those actions that contribute
directly to survival are important. But can anyone argue thus who has actua=
lly
faced disaster? In such situations, despair is the greatest enemy of all‚Äî=
and
the enemy that the Troubadour fights the hardest. We provide hope, we of the
word and the melody. Or, more correctly, with our tales and songs we remind
those around us of the value of hope. We inspire them with tales of past
victories. We give them courage with tales of people who, beset by gloom,
remained defiant and undismayed. We sing of sun on the grass, the laughter =
of
children, the whispering of the winds through the forests, the dance of a
stream that flows down from the mountains, the touch of parent or child or
lover. Why? To remind people that life is worth living, a truth that is eas=
ily
forgotten under the shadow of danger. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>This facet of =
our
art underwent its greatest trial during the Scourge, before the kaers were
opened once more to the sun and the sky. How easy it would have been for the
Namegiver races to have abandoned hope! Whole generations were born within =
the
wombs of stone, knowing they would live and die without walking free under =
the
endless sky. Whole generations knew that they, and their children, and even
their children‚Äôs children, would be confined‚Äî imprisoned!‚Äîwithin cell=

you saw a Troubadour perform, esteemed reader. No doubt she recited tales a=

performed songs, some of which you remembered as traditional stories of your
childhood, and some of which were completely new to you. Even when she was
reciting a poem you knew word for word as a child, did she not infuse it wi=
th a
fresh spirit, with the energy and enthusiasm that mark the work of a good
Troubadour? Of course! And when she retold one of the ancient odes‚ÄîJaron =
and
the Sphinx, perhaps, or the Ballad of Nioku‚Äîdid she not match word for wo=

and the Sphinx, but if told without the talent for performance, who would
listen? Similarly, someone who does not follow the way of the Troubadour co=

others outside the Discipline (in other words, an audience). My training, by
way of example, began with the former. I had the fortune of being able to r=

reciting in their entirety Follow the Plow and The Farmer‚Äôs Wife is Milki=

considered wise classify sages as a kind of ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù within the Disc=

Troubadour. A sage knows the correct wording of epics such as the Battle of=
 Sky
Point, and she understands the historical subtext and poetic allusions it
contains. Thus, one could argue that sages serve as repositories of knowled=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Berahnt had won
renown for his deeds. But one day Berahnt grew weary. He had seen too much
blood spilled. He no longer thirsted for victory. He wanted only rest. And =
so
Berahnt left his old comrades, left the battlefields and journeyed to a pla=
ce
known as the Land of Green in search of peace. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Now the Land of
Green was inhabited by tribes of humans. Unknown to Berahnt, these humans w=
ere
at war with one another, struggling for control of a watering hole known as
Garlen‚Äôs Bounty. The watering hole was large and provided more than enough
water for both tribes. But each fought to possess it entirely, for neither
could bear to see the other prosper. However, Garlen‚Äôs Bounty was easy to
overrun and nearly impossible to defend. And so neither side could hold the
site. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Berahnt sought=
 only
to while away his final days in solitude and contemplation, and so he built
himself a hut far from the watering hole. But soon humans of the first trib=
e,
the Sadar, came upon his hut. Though he did them no harm, they attacked him=
. He
easily defeated them, severely injuring their soldiers and driving them off.
The wounded Sadar returned to their elders and told their tale. The Sadar
elders were clever. Instead of seeking vengeance, they decided to win Berah=
nt
to their side. For the Land of Green was so isolated that the way of the
Warrior had not yet reached them, and they wished Berahnt to initiate their
soldiers into the Discipline and lead them to victory against their foes, t=
he
Radas. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Meanwhile, the=
 Radas
too stumbled upon Berahnt‚Äôs hut and set upon the Warrior without cause. A=
nd
like their enemies, they learned a painful lesson and were driven off. Then
they reported to their elders, who came to the same conclusion as those of =
the
Sadar village. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>As the Passions
would have it, ambassadors from both the Sadar and Radas appeared before
Berahnt at the same time. Both petitioned for the knowledge that would enab=
le
them to destroy their foes forever. Berahnt refused both requests. Instead,=
 he
attempted to broker a peace between the two tribes, but they would have non=
e of
it. Both ambassadors left, swearing vengeance upon Berahnt. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>In the months =
that
followed, Radas and Sadar raiding parties came to bring Berahnt to heel,
destroying his peace again and again. Each time Berahnt drove them off, and
each time he hoped that they would cease their pointless assaults against h=
im.
But finally he realized they would never yield. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>So Berahnt wen=
t to
Garlen‚Äôs Bounty, which was then possessed by the Radas. He killed each and
every Radas there. The Sadar then rejoiced and attacked Berahnt, believing =
they
would finally win their goal. But Berahnt slew each and every Sadar as well,
and Garlen‚Äôs Bounty ran red with the blood of the slain. Sickened, Berahnt
returned to his hut, where he whiled away the rest of his days in peace. </=

swords. The potential Warrior soon feels the pull of the weapon and shield =
in
her hands, even when they are but playthings. One day, the youngster simply
knows that she is a Warrior. Then it is only a matter of time. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Typically the
Warrior-to-be seeks out an ‚Äúorder‚Äù of Warriors, whether it be a mercena=
ry order
or a standing army. She applies as a squire. Masters of the order, instruct=
ed
in the rudiments of each beginning talent, test the squire. Those who truly
have the aptitude are sent out to drill in these procedures. And drill, and
drill. Typically, the student drills for many months before achieving her g=
oal:
an abrupt flash of understanding that is the soldier‚Äôs initiation. For so=
me,
this point never comes; they are not cut out for the Warrior path. Others
progress and continue to learn new talents as they build their legends. Each
time, they must seek a master of the talent, who explains the talent‚Äôs
fundamentals. Then the Warrior goes to the drilling ground and attempts to =
put
these fundamentals into practice. Training becomes simply a matter of doing,
and doing, and doing, until the Warrior‚Äôs pattern connects to the pattern=
 of
the talent. Then the Warrior has mastered it, and that is that.</p>

openly, and expects others to do the same. He admires doers and regards with
suspicion those who talk too much. He often tries getting things done in th=
e simplest,
most straightforward manner possible. Though an expert in the art of war, t=
he
average Warrior does not love combat; rather, he sees fighting as a nasty j=
ob

Warriors, bloodthirsty thoughts or behavior are improper; the true Warrior

other Warriors. Some even choose to live apart from the rest of society in
small ‚Äúsoldier‚Äù orders composed entirely of adepts and structured like a
military unit. Roving mercenary bands may also call their groupings ‚Äúorde=

camaraderie of all these orders makes them feared opponents on the battlefi=

the Sky Raider and occasionally the Cavalryman as a bloodthirsty brigand who
enjoys killing for its own sake, and the Archer as too inclined toward
mysticism. On the whole, though, the Archer and Cavalryman Disciplines appe=

followers of the other fighting Disciplines, and may seek the Nethermancer‚=

Warriors may also be drawn to the Elementalist‚Äôs way; because many Warrior

putting together another one of his books, is he? All about adepts this tim=

Well, I‚Äôm glad to see you‚Äôve decided to give a Weaponsmith a chance to =
speak
up. Of all the adepts, we‚Äôre probably the least understood. Weaponsmiths?=
 Oh,
those fellows that pound steel and make weapons and armor, right? Well, we =
do
make weapons and armor, the best you‚Äôll find. But we do so much more.
Weaponsmiths live in the world, not just on it. During our travels we speak
with the people of Barsaive. We learn of their hopes, dreams and
disappointments. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>We Weaponsmiths
stick together like adepts of no other Discipline, for the bonds of our For=
ges
are as strong as those of any family. Weaponsmiths are a tightly knit group,
able to rely on each other for damn near anything. If a Weaponsmith shows u=
p at
his Forge in need, his fellow adepts will do whatever they can to help him =
out.
Much of our camaraderie and closeness stems from our shared dedication to o=
ur
work. Just look around‚ÄîI‚Äôll wager a week‚Äôs work you can‚Äôt find a gr=
oup of
adepts who, as a whole, are as dedicated as we. A Weaponsmith says somethin=
g is
going to get done, it gets done. Take my word for it. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>You seek proof=
? Look
at this. It‚Äôs called a heartblade. I‚Äôve been working on mine for near t=
o six
years now and haven‚Äôt come close to finishing it. Everything I am‚Äîheart=
, soul
and mind‚Äîhas gone into making this. At some point in his life, just about=
 every
Weaponsmith gets the desire to make a heartblade. It represents the ultimate
combination of art and technique, for a heartblade is as individual as its
maker and as important to the Weaponsmith as his eyes or hands. Heartblades=
 are
proof of what we are, of the strength of our Discipline. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The same dedic=
ation
that makes us single-minded enough to create heartblades also provided us w=
ith
the strength to resist the bane of our time. Horrors hate Weaponsmiths, bec=
ause
we know better than any other adepts how to strengthen our resolve against =
them.
So if you go after Horrors, you best bring a few of us along with you. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>But dedication=
 is
only one of the unique characteristics of Weaponsmiths. We‚Äôre also close =
to the
people. Our Forges serve as meeting places, schools for apprentices, and co=
mmon
areas for people of all types. They come in, talk to us while we work, watc=
h us
shape metal into objects both lethal and beautiful. They tell us things,
sometimes ask us to deliver messages to other people, for some of us travel
quite a bit. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>In these ways,
Weaponsmiths become the ties that bind people together. Perhaps this is why
ours has become the most enduring Discipline. Some even claim the way of the
Weaponsmith was the first Discipline, and that all the other Disciplines gr=
ew
from it. That may be‚Äîseems like every Discipline comes back to us, at any=
 rate.

Any group of adepts that heads off looking for legend better bring a

guilds known as Forges. Our Forges provide us with places to meet and work =
and
also a steady supply of new recruits. Unlike the Disciplines of the Swordma=
ster
or Warrior, you won‚Äôt find too many young ones that want to run off and b=
ecome
Weaponsmiths. More often than not, they sort of slide into the Discipline.
Usually, candidates start off working for us to make a little spending mone=
y.
Some discover they enjoy the labor and stay for a while. Those who don‚Äôt
sometimes go off to become adepts of other Disciplines or find work more su=
ited

the Forge, though, are rewarded handsomely. For Weaponsmiths watch over all=
 who
work for them, and anyone who stays at the Forge for more than a few months=
 is
recognized as adept material. These we introduce to more advanced forms of =
metalworking,
watching as they work the iron to see whether or not they fall in tune with=
 the
metal. If they do, some member of the Forge ‚Äúadopts‚Äù the worker and beg=

apprenticeship. </p>

bellows and anvil, hammering out horseshoes, shovel blades and other simple
pieces of ironwork. The mentor watches every step of the apprentice‚Äôs wor=
k,
quick to criticize but slow to praise. An apprentice may spend a week learn=
ing
how to form nails, constantly banging on tiny pieces of metal until they all
come out just the right shape and size, with as little metal wasted as
possible. Such tiring and tedious chores strengthen the resolve and
attentiveness of the would-be adept, forging the dedication and iron will f=
or
which Weaponsmiths are known. Such training may seem harsh, but it is our w=
ay.
The working of metal is a learned gift, not a birthright, and poorly done w=

spends his days laboring over the forge and anvil, he spends his nights in =
deep
study. The Weaponsmith must be well versed in all aspects of metalwork,
including the history of the art. Apprentices study Weaponsmiths of the dis=
tant
past, as well as the weapons those adepts created and the methods they used.
This study forms the seed from which the Weaponsmith‚Äôs well of knowledge =
will
one day spring, the index of a mental encyclopedia. This is why I can say,
without fear of boasting, that Weaponsmiths know more about weapon history =
than
anyone else. If it can be known, a Weaponsmith somewhere knows it. Mark my
words on this. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>A Weaponsmith‚=

apprenticeship lasts from six to eight months, depending on the aptitude of=

apprentice and that of his master. In cases where apprentice and mentor are
ill-suited to one another, the training can take much longer. If such an ill
match forms, other members of the Forge may step in and assign the mentor a=
 new
apprentice and the apprentice a new mentor. There is no shame in this: tale=
nt
has little to do with personality, which can play a major role in the
instruction of apprentices. I myself have had more than one apprentice with
whom I could not work. All were reassigned to different mentors, and all ha=

their votes on the Circles and level-headedness of the elders. Most
Weaponsmiths are considered elder material after reaching Tenth Circle, tho=

some are chosen sooner or later. (I was chosen as an elder at Eighth Circle,

test the adept‚Äôs mental acuity and grasp of history as much as his physic=
al
abilities and knowledge of metalworking. Beginning with the Fifth Circle, t=
he focus
of testing shifts from the working of metal to the knowledge that must
accompany that ability. For example, the elders begin testing the adept‚Äôs
knowledge of weapon history, often basing the test on one of the weapons ea=
ch
Forge keeps in its safe house. The Forge usually holds some knowledge of th=
ese
weapons, having catalogued and documented a few of their pertinent facts
through their own talents and the labor of various adepts testing for Fifth
Circle, but all still keep some secrets. During advancement testing, Forge
elders offer one such weapon to candidates and instruct them to study the
weapon for a specific period‚Äîusually a week to a month, depending on the =
Circle
the adept wishes to achieve and the complexity of the weapon being examined=
. At
the end of the time allotted, the candidate must return to the elders and
relate his findings. The elders then decide whether the candidate displays
sufficient knowledge for advancement. Adepts attempting to attain the Ninth
Circle of the Discipline must undertake a most daunting task. Each Forge ke=
eps
a list of weapons lost before or during the Scourge. The advancement candid=
ate
undergoes forty hours of training at the Forge and then sets out to redisco=
ver
one of these weapons. Often, the weapon is related to a weapon that the ade=
pt
has studied before, providing the Weaponsmith a good idea of where to start=
 his
search. Once the adept finds the weapon, he must restore it to its former g=
lory
and present the weapon to the Forge elders. </p>

search out ghost masters to continue their training, for most of us feel un=

higher, and then only to those in genuine need of such extreme measures. Th=

Weaponsmiths who may be traveling far from a Forge will often be taught the

explain to a young would-be Archer or Sky Raider, but sometimes digging in =
and
helping out the common folk scrabbling to make a living on the surface of
Barsaive can be infinitely more important than running off to kill Horrors.
This desire to help our fellow Namegivers inspires many of our Discipline to
wander far and wide. We go where we are needed, traveling from village to c=

most good. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Crafting a
heartblade is arguably the single most important task any Weaponsmith ever =
sets
for himself. The heartblade represents the fusion of a Weaponsmith with his
Discipline, the culmination of his learning. In the heartblade, the Weapons=
mith
creates a powerful pattern item of his own. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Weaponsmiths s=
pend
many, many years working on their heartblades, striving to make them as per=
fect
as possible. A Weaponsmith may begin crafting his heartblade only when given
permission to do so by his elders. This permission is only granted to those=
 who
perform exceptionally well in their advancement trials. As soon as an adept
shows above-average skill during his testing to attain a new Circle, the el=
ders
choose an instructor to guide the Weaponsmith through the three weeks of
training necessary to learn the basics of forging the heartblade. From then=
 on,
whenever the adept trains for successive advancements, he spends another th=
ree
weeks learning more about forging the heartblade. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Creating a
heartblade involves eight distinct phases. First, the Weaponsmith must craft
the hilt, a lengthy process during which the adept must imagine how the bla=
de
will fit the grip and how all the pieces of the blade will work together. N=
ext,
the Weaponsmith embellishes the pommel, beginning by finding just the right
item to install in the pommel. The item must represent the Weaponsmith and =
his
art. Gems are a common choice, as are small iron ornaments the Weaponsmith
crafts himself. The adept affixes the item to the end of the hilt and fashi=
ons
the pommel around it. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>In the third p=
hase,
the Weaponsmith creates the guard. The guard may be simple or ornate, though
Weaponsmiths usually give their heartblades complex guards, with quillons
curving out every which way from the hilt of the weapon. The fourth phase is
finding the ore for the blade, which must come from within a lost kaer.
Generally, Weaponsmiths take the material from ancient weapons. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Purifying the =
metal
for the blade is the fifth phase. This time-consuming process is also the m=
ost
crucial, for if the Weaponsmith fails during this phase, the heartblade is
ruined and he must begin the process anew. For the sixth phase, the adept
forges the blade. Most Weaponsmiths consider this phase the simplest in the
creation process, as they have nearly achieved mastery of blade forging by =
the
time they craft their heartblade. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>In the seventh
phase, the adept joins the blade to the hilt and performs any necessary
re-balancing. During the eighth and final phase, the Weaponsmith sharpens t=
he
blade and adds any final decorations. Then he performs a blood magic ritual=
 to
tie the item‚Äôs pattern to his own. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>As soon as the
heartblade is completed, the Weaponsmith achieves a deeper understanding of=
 his
art and himself. It is said that Weaponsmiths carrying heartblades are among
the greatest adepts to walk the earth. </p>

ty of
Barsaive contains at least one Forge, and all but the most minor or distant
villages count Weaponsmiths among their number. Forges consist of no fewer =
than
five Weaponsmiths, with two elders for every five members. Thus, a Forge of=
 ten
members would include six adepts and four elders. An elder must have reache=
d at
least the Eighth Circle of his Discipline and is responsible for training
adepts, recruiting new apprentices and managing the daily operations of the
Forge. Unlike most adepts, Weaponsmiths understand the business application=
s of
their skills; most Forges make a profit from the talents of their members. =

sketches, and prepare test pieces, before he works on the weapon itself. At=
 the
end of this month the character makes a Half-magic Test. The Difficulty Num=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>When we perfor=
m, the
performance almost never consists of a single art form alone. In most cases=
, we
use as many forms and styles as possible to entertain and educate our audie=
nce.
We sing, we speak, and we play instruments. And yes, we dance. You might be
able to understand the music, but a ground-stomper who understands a windli=
ng‚Äôs
dance is a rare sight.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Our dance takes
place in the air, naturally, and we Winddancers excel at this, because we
understand the language of flight and, in contrast to most other windlings,=
 can
speak it intentionally. You see, most Namegivers can read feelings of joy or
grief in another‚Äôs face, and even more if they have an aptitude for it.
Windlings not only express feelings in their face, but also in the way they
fly. A sad windling tends to fly slower than usual while letting his head h=
ang
down, for example. If a windling is in a nervous mood, his body usually has=
 an
angle, with his arms alongside it, while looking straight forward. We
Winddancers are masters when it comes to figuring out someone else‚Äôs emot=
ions.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>We also master=
 the
expression of any emotion that way, by adjusting our flight. This is perhaps
the most intricate windling art, because it is difficult for us to hide our
true emotions, especially in the language of flight. When a Winddancer
performs, the song expresses the story, his movement expresses the actions =
of
the characters, and the language of flight expresses emotions. Add instrume=
nts
to that, or the hum of our wings. A Winddancer is a whole group of artists =
all
by himself: singer, musician, dancer, storyteller, actor. Ever seen someone
else able to do this? Of course, it‚Äôs not that no one has tried before.</=

build shelters in the trees and hunt from the air, it defines how we act‚Äî
especially windling adepts. A windling Beastmaster tends to work with the
creatures of the air, windling Archers always have the higher ground and so=
 on.
Windlings know more about the air than any other Namegiver (save perhaps a
dragon). The air carries our voices and ourselves during performance. We ha=

learned to understand this element: its ways, moods, and even its personali=

for hours, and air elementals can hover above the ground without effort. Th=

is why we enjoy flying so much‚Äîit‚Äôs a gift that we don‚Äôt take for gra=

of other cultures we embraced as our own. For us, there‚Äôs not much of a
difference between tradition and art‚Äîthe Dance of Spring, the Song of

‚Ä¶ pardon me? Yes, kidding of course. Why haven‚Äôt other races got a sens=
e of
humor? Sometimes you dwarfs are no better than a pack of clumsy trolls. Whe=
re
was I? Oh yes, our ability to fly. It‚Äôs obvious that this ability, combin=
ed
with our graceful yet somehow weak physical bodies, allowed us to develop
unique fighting styles. A windling is always in danger in combat. Sure,
everybody involved in combat is in danger, but for a windling, most fights =
are
life threatening. Not only can a single blow injure us severely, but it can
knock us down to the ground, where we are not very agile and can hardly avo=
id
the blows and kicks of opponents. From first-hand experience, I can safely =
say
that falling injured to the ground from a height of ten feet or more hurts,
really hurts. That‚Äôs the situation my master called ‚Äútaking two hits at=
 once‚Äù.
Windlings soon came up with two ways to avoid direct melee combat. One was
shooting with arrows‚Äìpreferably poisoned‚Äì from a safe distance. Spellca=
sting is
essentially the same‚Äîbut while only few windlings become spellcasters, mo=
st of
us are able to fire an arrow into a troll‚Äôs eye. The other way is more
dangerous, but also more exciting. It‚Äôs the way of the Windmaster.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Maybe you‚Äôve=
 seen
one of these troll Sky Raiders tapping into the magic of his Discipline to =
get
high above his enemy and strike down with a devastating blow. How crude does
that look? A windling doesn‚Äôt even need to use magic for that, thanks to =
our
ability to fly. Granted, such a strike is usually a lot less devastating wh=
en
performed by a windling. That others don‚Äôt think us capable of it is quit=
e an
advantage, believe me.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>So we know that
striking from above increases the power of a blow, and Windmasters improve =
upon
this technique, taking it to a new level, diving in for the kill. Thus, the
first lesson of our Discipline is the Rush. We strike out of the dark, out =
of
hiding places such as trees, from where our enemy least expects it. From ab=
ove.
A swift attack and a swift retreat out of the reach of most opponents‚Äîtha=
t‚Äôs
the way a Windmaster fights. Diving out of the cover of a tree directly to =
hit
an opponent hard before he realizes what hit him makes us tiny people might=
y.
Also, everything we do is about speed. I can‚Äôt allow my opponent to be pr=
epared
for my charge on him, and I can‚Äôt allow him to see where I go after rearr=
anging
his teeth. Obviously, enemy archers are a threat even for a Windmaster, so =
we
try to stay out of sight and dodge their arrows if necessary. A well-hidden
Windmaster is a living Windmaster‚Äî and a victorious one!</p>

factors don‚Äôt apply to combat only; they also influence our way of thinki=

general. They show us that, when acting, one better have a plan on how to g=
et
away with it‚Äîpreferably fast, or all the action is over. Naturally, there=
 are
different ways to fly, just like there are different ways to walk. Opponents
and battlefields differ, so we employ other fighting techniques as well.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>In general, we=
 rely
a lot on speed during a fight. The ability we call the Dance is the pinnacl=
e of
this tactic. It‚Äôs more dangerous than the Rush, but also more fun against
clumsy opponents, and sometimes simply necessary, due to limits of space.
Imagine that you might have difficulties following your opponent‚Äôs moveme=
nts in
combat. He steps left and right, he moves forward and back. If you fight a
windling, add up and down to that (and add a lot of speed since we fly fast=
er
than most people run). The Dance is all about moving around the
opponent‚Äìnothing‚Äôs more fun than to fly around the head of an enemy (es=
pecially
if it‚Äôs a troll, that‚Äôs for sure!), distract him with your speed, and h=
it him
with a series of blows, while he struggles with his inability to hit you and
becomes too distracted to notice where the next attack will come from.</p>

like me. A Windmaster is able to deliver many tiny cuts, which may be unner=
ving
at the beginning, but become more and more dangerous for his victim‚Äìuntil=
 it is
finally defeated (either by the damage of all the attacks or from being una=
ble
to hold up continuously). I won a great number of fights with this techniqu=
e,
avoiding all attacks of my opponent while attacking him swiftly. This knocks
him out eventually, although I prefer to quickly fly out of my enemy‚Äôs ra=

prowess in combat. The Swordmaster Discipline is often regarded as too flas=

neutral, and may or may not be of use to the Windmaster, depending on where=
 his
interests lie.</p>

of false presumptions on the part of his philosophy, of course. See, the Sc=
outs
say they become one with their surroundings. Becoming one with the world, w=
hat
a foolish thought! Everybody living is part of the world already. How can we
become more part of it? Scouts become so immersed in it that they are hardly
noticed. You see where this leads? There are just two things in existence, =
the
Scout and the world, and the Scout has the special ability to become part of
the world! There is no tree, and there is no Jeeth and no Thom, there is on=
ly
the rest of the world and the Scout standing out of it. How egocentric is t=
hat?
The worst part is that Scouts perceive all things in the world as single
objects, as if they were just some sorts of scenery to act in. They look for
you if they want something, but otherwise you aren‚Äôt important to them. T=
hey
wish to be left alone, because they think they are the all-seeing ones among
the blind. Become one with the world ‚Ä¶ ha! They‚Äôve lost themselves, I‚Ä=
ôd say.
Reality is composed of individuals; it‚Äôs not a whole, unified thing you c=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>We Windscouts
observe what‚Äôs going on before deciding how to act. One of my first tests
arranged by my master was to find a water strider on the lake close to our
village. I looked at the lake, but saw none. I flew up high, because I thou=
ght
perhaps the lake was shaped like a water strider, and my mentor wanted to s=
how
me how important an elevated position was. Not the case. I approached him, =
told
him I couldn‚Äôt find anything. He told me to think about it. I had to dist=
ance
myself not physically, but mentally, I had to think if what I was supposed =
to
look for was likely to be found at all. The solution was easy: it was rain
season, and water striders wouldn‚Äôt come to the lake at this time. Had I =
only
thought about it without looking, I wouldn‚Äôt have passed the test. I coul=
dn‚Äôt
possibly know for sure, and my mentor could have placed one of these creatu=
res
there for me to spot it. In addition, if I thought of it as impossible, but=
 had
seen it with my very own eyes, I would have been obliged to make sure it was
real and not some illusion made to trick me. Sounds quite complicated, I kn=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>My point is th=
at we
are objective. Windscouts don‚Äôt take things for granted, and we distance
ourselves from things so we can analyze them. It is that step back that mak=

our way unique. We don‚Äôt act on instinct; we act on intelligence. Of cour=

intellect is more difficult to master than instinct, and so it is the prima=

regarding our Discipline‚Äôs Name is that it features the word ‚Äúwind‚Äù b=

are Scouts in the wind, native to the element of air. But we don‚Äôt need t=
he
wind to carry us; no‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need wind if you have wings and muscles.=
 We need
wind to see and to perceive the world. The wind carries smells far and wide;
farther than you can see and hear. And while the latter senses are more
accurate on a general level, smell has the advantage of reach and persisten=
ce.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>You can‚Äôt te=

many apples are on a tree by its smell alone, but as a Windscout, you can s=
mell
the tree before you see it‚Äîand be able to find it. Also, smell lingers, a=

you pluck all the apples from the tree, their scent will still be there whe=

something others pay little attention to, because most people have a weak s=
ense
of smell, and because they even tend to ignore it most of the day. The
Namegiver in front of me might look like an ork, but if his smell tells me =
he
is a t‚Äôskrang, he might actually be an Illusionist. If I don‚Äôt open my =

Windscouts are the best hunters and gatherers you can find. And they are the
best warriors, too. Well, technically windling Warriors are the best warrio=
rs,
but many clans don‚Äôt distinguish between hunters and warriors. We can spo=
t any
prey and follow it. We can find any fruit and tell by its smell if it‚Äôs b=
arely
edible or ripe. And we can watch our lands for intruders, and if there seem=
s to
be a fight, we can support every other windling fighter with our
reconnaissance. Because we are few in number, we direct our attention to th=
ose
tasks others can‚Äôt fulfill. A Windscout doesn‚Äôt waste his time picking =
the
fruits from the first tree he finds‚Äîthe harvest is done by other clan mem=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>That‚Äôs true =
in more
dangerous situations as well. Although I am quite a capable fighter, I have
rarely let my blades speak in the battles I have witnessed. Instead, I prov=

insights to my comrades. Doesn‚Äôt mean I never swung my swords, but when I=
 did it
was mostly because the situation didn‚Äôt allow me to tell my friends what =
had to
be done, or doing so would have negated the advantage of surprise. Archers,
Swordmasters, Warriors‚Äìthey all know their field of expertise better than=
 any

he
did was to look at the tourney chart, think of all opponents he could face =

take his time to examine each and every one of them, starting days before t=

first fight. He knew what armor they were wearing and where it had weak spo=

to perform wondrous supernatural acts by discerning these higher meanings.
Acquiring this understanding is known among teachers and students of the

to the floor, flopping about like a fish out of water, refusing to enter yo=

ears. That is because the proper word for the thing upon which you sit is
‚Äúthrone.‚Äù A ‚Äúthrone‚Äù is no mere chair; it is a symbol. It represent=
s kingship.
Your throne is an example of an object that carries a Great Meaning. A chair
means nothing; a throne means something. Likewise, Your Serene Majesty is a=
lso
a symbol. The name ‚ÄúVarulus‚Äù does not refer merely to a dwarf. It refer=

further in a moment. Because it is a symbol, Your Majesty‚Äôs throne has mo=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Unlike other
Disciplines, whose adherents feel the tenets of their crafts in their bones,
the Discipline of the Wizard requires the adept to clearly understand the
principles of his way in his mind. He must be a thinker, with a brain as sh=
arp
and cutting as a knife. He must learn to separate truth from falsehood,
importance from triviality. The mind is the most important gift given to we
Namegivers by the Passions; the Wizard takes this extraordinarily valuable =
tool
and uses it to its fullest. With his mind, he remakes the world. </p>

of thought, the limitless vistas of the imagination. For practitioners of t=
he lesser
Disciplines, the first moments of initiation may come in a sudden f lash of
mystical awareness. Our way is not so easy. Only the trained mind is prepar=
ed
for the ultimate insights of the Wizardly path. The prospective Wizard must
build a mental foundation for the profound perceptions to come. Achieving t=
his
requires extensive study. The Wizard therefore spends the early years of his
life wrestling with dusty tome after dusty tome, immersing himself in the w=
orks
of the great Wizards of Barsaive‚Äôs past. </p>

symbol for all transmitted learning. Many young Wizards, particularly in
Barsaive‚Äôs misbegotten hinterlands, are nowadays forced to learn the great
works as part of an oral tradition. Books require the painstaking labor of
large numbers of scribes. Because they are expensive and time-consuming to
produce, they are rare at the best of times. The Scourge has made them even
harder to find, and so many small villages cannot lay hands on anything clo=
se
to the entire corpus of texts necessary for the Wizard-in-training. To
compensate for this dreadful lack, tutors of the Wizardly arts have taken to
memorizing vast portions of the books missing from their own collections and
then reciting them to their students. Though this way of teaching is
unfortunately necessary, I fear that many subtle but essential points are l=
ost
by its practice. The hinterlands of Barsaive continue to produce large numb=
ers
of half-taught, bumpkin mages who learn by hearsay rather than by reading t=

eminent works of the past for themselves. While this kind of slow erosion is
perhaps acceptable for Nethermancers, Elementalists and Illusionists, it is
most regrettable that the noble tradition of the Wizard should be degraded =

reality according to his desires, one must understand this concept. All thi=

in this world are connected to an Idea. Your walking stick, Your Majesty,
shares the Idea of the walking stick in common with all other walking stick=
s.
Your throne shares the Idea of the throne with all the thrones of all the
monarchs that have ever existed or will exist. But where do these Ideas come
from? The Wizard knows that the Idea of the throne, the Idea of the walking
stick, was not created by Namegivers. There is a place, a real place deep in
the heart of astral space, a place that even the Horrors cannot reach, in w=
hich
all Ideas exist. Were it possible to travel to this Realm of Ideas, one wou=
ld
find there The Walking Stick‚Äîthe original, mystical emanation upon which =
all
walking sticks in our own reality are modeled. Anything you can think of has
such a model in the Realm of Ideas. If it did not, you would not be able to
think of it. Whenever a new object or being is created in this world, that
creation merely reflects events in the Realm of Ideas, which on occasion
spontaneously generates new things. (I have chosen the term ‚Äúthing‚Äù
specifically for its vagueness; an Idea might be a type of being, an object=
, or
even an abstract concept.) When the t‚Äôskrang race developed‚Äîwith the Pa=
ssion
Upandal‚Äôs aid‚Äîthe peculiar engine that propels their riverboats, their =
actions
reflected the appearance of a new thing called The Engine in the Realm of
Ideas. If The Engine had not appeared there, the t‚Äôskrang would not have
thought to try to make such objects here in this world. The Idea must exist
first. </p>

Flame meant destruction for my purposes, and therefore became destruction‚Ä=

Bartertown is a manifestation of the Idea of the City. What is a city? Firs=

all, it is a coming together of Namegivers for a common purpose and a
collective livelihood. Therefore, the City symbolizes Unity and Cooperation.
These are positive symbols, I am sure you will agree. But not all cities are
good places. Kratas, for example, combines the Idea of the City with the Id=
ea
of the Thief, and this latter Idea exerts a baleful influence over the firs=
t.
Kratas is a gathering-together like any city, but for the purposes of
conspiracy. If Kratas was on your doorstep, I would recommend that you atte=

 the
Idea of Trade. What is trade? It is exchange, the free transfer of goods fr=
om
one willing partner to the next. Trade is another form of cooperation, and =
thus
Bartertown is doubly woven to the Idea of Cooperation. </p>

may
seem untidy and unruly; it may offend the sense of order that your dwarf
heritage leads you to value; but in truth, Bartertown is a manifestation of=
 the
highest order. It can be a tool by which you may bind our land in your

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The following =
tale
will serve as an example of how Correspondences and Antipathies work in the
world. Some years ago, I was trapped with my adventuring companions in a sm=
all
village kaer in the lowlands south of Lake Vors. Moments after we entered t=
he
kaer, I saw that the Idea of the Kaer had been connected to another, very
strange Idea. The kaer‚Äôs walls were of worked and polished metal. The des=
ign of
the place was maze-like. And when the last of our party had stepped inside =
the
kaer, a mammoth door of stone slammed down behind us, blocking our exit. Wi=
th
no choice but to go further into this oddly altered place, we soon found
ourselves in a trap sickening in its depravity. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>First, another=
 stone
door sealed all of us in another, inner chamber of worked and polished meta=
l.
Then a trap door opened beneath our Beastmaster and sucked her out of sight
with a hideous whooshing sound. We pounded furiously on the floor in an att=
empt
to reopen the trap door and follow her. We had threaded ourselves together =
in a
group pattern in order to symbolize our unity, and we had sworn never to al=
low
our party to become separated. But this terrible trap-kaer set all our effo=
rts
at naught. We could not reopen the trap door, and our Beastmaster seemed lo=
st
to us. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>As we pounded =
and
shouted, one of the metal walls began to sink into the f loor. Behind it was
yet another wall, of a mysterious clear substance that I have yet to match =
to a
governing Idea. Through that clear wall we could see our comrade, sitting i=
n a daze
in a chamber much like the one we were in. Seeing us, she rushed over to the
wall. We hammered at it from both sides, to no avail. Clearly one of the
symbols of the clear wall was Invulnerability. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Portions of the
walls in the Beastmaster‚Äôs room then shifted, revealing an array of spout=
s that
gushed forth streams of water. The second chamber was a drowning trap,
fiendishly made so that we could only look on helplessly as our comrade met=
 a
slow and awful death. Our Archer made a quick mathematical determination, a=
nd
told us that it would take but three minutes for the chamber to fill entire=
ly
with water. After that, our Beastmaster had only as much life as she had lu=
ng
power. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>I immediately =
went
to work, rifling through my sack for the notes I had taken some weeks earli=
er
in the course of a rare opportunity to consult the dread book titled Horror=
s, a
volume reluctantly compiled and jealously guarded by the librarians of the =
Great
Library of Throal. Something about the nature of this place rang a faint be=
ll
in my memory. Lo and behold, I found‚Äîafter much page-shuffling‚Äîmy notes=
 on an
entry regarding the Great Horror named Artificer. Reading quickly, I learned
that Artificer travels throughout Barsaive, searching out places likely to
attract adventurers. It then remakes these places, filling them with deadly
traps of devious construction. I knew that this trap-kaer was connected not
only to the Idea of the Kaer, but to the Idea of the Horror, and through it=
 to
the Idea of the Machine. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>I concentrated=
 fully
on my task, blocking out the horrified shrieks of my companions as the water
rose higher and higher in the other chamber. I grabbed my copy of Vomon and
riffled to the entry on the Idea of the Machine. Vomon lists symbols that
relate to an Idea‚Äîcalled Correspondences‚Äîand also Ideas and Symbols tha=
t are
the opposites of these Correspondences. The latter are called Antipathies. =

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>One of the
Antipathies for the Machine was the Idea of Air. The text explained that on=
e of
the symbols of Air is Rust, which is the enemy of Metal, and therefore of t=
he
Machine. Air, I thought frantically, Air! How can I connect to this symbol =
for
Air? </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>By this time, =
the
water had reached the top of the chamber. My companions were either weeping=
 or
screaming in despair. The Beastmaster had filled her lungs with air and was=
 now
gazing sadly at us, waiting for the inevitable moment when her lips would b=
urst
open and let the brine come rushing in. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>I was already =
hard
at work, reattuning my matrix to insert the spell I needed. With no time to
spare as the moments slipped past, I wove the threads and cast a Compression
Bubble spell around my dear companion. (Compression Bubble usually harms the
target, but I knew that any damage to my durable colleague would be minor
compared to drowning.) A large bubble of air appeared around her, allowing =
her
to breathe. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>My companions
exulted, shouting in delight at this victory. And as their tears turned from
sorrowful drops to joyous ones, the waters began to recede‚Äîas I knew they
would. </p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The text on
Artificer revealed that it derived its mystical power from the suffering ca=
used
by its traps. From this, I deduced that the traps themselves were triggered=
 by
negative emotions, such as trepidation and despair. My Compression Bubble s=
pell
bought our dying Beastmaster a momentary respite, which boosted my companio=
ns‚Äô
flagging morale. Their sudden, intense joy canceled out the emotional energy
powering the trap, thus saving our partner. </p>

escape from Artificer‚Äôs kaer is a tale for another day. You can see from =

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Of late, I have
encountered many who claim to be so-called instinctive Wizards. These scruf=

excuses for spellcasters would not be caught dead with a collection of book=

hand. They learned their talents and spells by word of mouth, from other he=
dge
Wizards. Though they carry in their heads badly jumbled memories of the sys=
tem
of Ideas and symbols, and a wholly inadequate list of Correspondences and
Antipathies, they claim they can nonetheless achieve true mastery of the
Wizard‚Äôs Discipline through experience. They simply invent their own
Correspondences and Antipathies based on the skimpy evidence of their own
lives! It is a wonder to me that any of them survive past the First Circle,=

who follow the path of mastery, which in my view goes beyond dignity into a

the power of Ideas; they believe they can control and dominate emanations f=
rom
the Realm of Ideas. They believe the world is theirs to manipulate as they
will, and see Wizardry as no more than a route to power. Theran Wizards oft=

choose this path; in the days before the Scourge, they planted this lamenta=

overweening confidence to force symbols to do his will. This path is a
hazardous one, for Ideas are more powerful than individuals. The so-called

pomposity and a tendency to quote inscrutable occult classics. Mind Wizards
trust the written word over oral tradition, and feel insecure without a cou=

exist, many of them believe their Discipline is superior to all others and =

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Some Wizards,
particularly those in the hinterlands, learn the Wizard Discipline based on=
 the
knowledge their master possesses, rather than from tomes and texts. Idea and
symbol still tend to be a part of their way of thinking about magic, but th=
ey
rely more on their own experiences than on the writings of others. These
‚Äúinstinctive‚Äù Wizards learn to work magic by deciding what each idea an=
d symbol
means to them personally. They tend to think and act with less arrogance th=
an
mind Wizards; many of them have a wry sense of humor and feel humbled in the
face of the wonders of the world. They often speak with rustic accents and =
act
with solid rural common sense. Proverbs and other bits of folk wisdom pepper
their conversations. They can be quick to dismiss the benefits of book

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>It has been sa=
id
that the Woodsman evolved from the hunters of old. Whether this is true or =
not,
our Discipline shares many similarities with hunters. You see, hunting is n=
ot
about killing as much deer as possible for a quick profit. In the old times=
, game
was necessary to survive, as there was less land available and magical farm=
ing
methods were not developed to their current extent. So it was important to =
the
hunter that he only took what was needed, and maybe saved something up for
later. This required him to strike with caution, and he had to think about =
his
actions. The same is true for the Woodsman. We never act lightly. This is g=
ood
news for you, because you can have a heated argument with a Woodsman and do=
 not
have to fear it will lead to a brawl or even bloodshed if you say an offens=
ive
word or two. But there is a downside as well: if you have made a Woodsman y=
our
enemy, he will act like a hunter. A hunter stalks his prey, and will plan h=
is
moves to an extent where he is unlikely to fail. A hunter would not allow
himself to fail, because failure threatens his survival. The same is true f=
or
us, especially in the defense of elven settlements. You can pass through our
lands without knowing that we are watching you, always prepared to strike i=
f the
need arises. If you don‚Äôt pose any danger, you‚Äôll leave our territory w=
ithout
being harmed, and probably without realizing that we‚Äôve been there.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>We always choo=
se our
actions wisely and always think twice about how to carry them out because o=
ur
actions are irreversible. As a long-lived race, we will have to suffer from=
 our
mistakes for a long time, and so it is obvious we avoid them in the first p=
lace.
If we care for a grove of trees and realize that the trees stand too close =
to
each other, we won‚Äôt just pick one on a whim. We observe before we choose=
 which
one to fell and why. Taming an animal? The same, as it makes no sense tamin=
g a
random animal, but to identify the most promising first.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Before the Sco=
urge,
Barsaive was covered with forests. Today we still have our major jungles and
the Blood Wood, but many other forests were decimated during the Scourge. T=
rust
me; I have seen them, centuries ago. Half of what are plains today were fil=
led
with trees back then. We lived there, in the forests, and many elves never =
left
the woods in their lifetimes. No need to go elsewhere, no need to allow any=
one
else on our lands. You can observe this even today, with the Blood Wood as a
major example. Their terrible thorns are not the only reason the blood elves
keep to themselves: they are following our ancient ways.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>&nbsp;</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Barsaivian cul=
ture
was different before the Scourge, too. We did not live closely with the oth=
er
races; we did not even share a language. We elves always preferred to remain
separated from the other races because our culture was centralized‚Äîelven
settlements did not care how their neighbors handled things, but looked to =
Wyrm
Wood for cultural guidance. The Elven Court was a part of our identity, and
denying one‚Äôs heritage meant denying one‚Äôs self in front of everyone, m=
aking
one an outcast of society. This was the way of things‚Äîand most of the tim=
e,
elves across the world did not have a problem with it. How established the
dominance of the queen and her court over elven culture and general life we=
re,
is reflected in the Schism. A whole culture divided by a small dispute over
some boats built in a human fashion.</p>

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Combine all of=
 this
and you will understand that we elves preferred living in our very own worl=

Is it surprising that we developed a Discipline that has its unique place in
this world of ours? The Woodsman was born of our culture, out of seclusion.=

Purifiers roam the land, far away from their Liferocks, acting for the good=
 of
everyone, not just the obsidiman race. Scouts explore every region;
Elementalists seek places of elemental magic across Barsaive. We Woodsmen a=
re
no generalists. We prefer the forest, and often stay close to our homes, to=
 the
many settlements that dot the woods, forests, and jungles of our province. =
Like
the t‚Äôskrang keeping to their riverboats and the unstoppable stream of the
Serpent River; the majority of Woodsmen don‚Äôt travel far from home, at le=
ast
not often. We stay close to our communities because they are all we have le=

since our separation from Wyrm Wood. We stay close to them because we want =
to
defend and enjoy this one place that is so vital to each of us, that small
village that substitutes for a court long lost.</p>

of an adept as a person who travels and experiences adventures. This is tru=

but not for every adept. It is not only the Woodsman who stays close to his
home. Take a walk through your city, and you will find many adepts that don=
‚Äôt
care much for adventuring. I know for a fact that some of your merchants and
your very own librarians are adepts. The way of the adept brings
responsibilities. There are more responsibilities than simple exploration a=

the
Wheel of Life, a series of paths each expressing a certain view of life. Am=

these, there are paths that focus inwards, on discovering one‚Äôs true self.
Other paths focus on the outside, on the world and other people. When follo=
wing
the latter paths, many Woodsmen leave their homes to explore the world. Not=
 all
of them do, nor do all follow the paths in the same way. For these adepts, =
my
earlier words become less important; they know that they will return home o=
n a

es
in leaving behind what they love, reveling in motion and exploration. They

guardians of our villages, our lands, and elven culture. Our role of being
guardians of all elves became less important when our culture was split by =
the
Schism and the Scourge, but remains true to this day. Guarding a village or=
 our
lands is a simple concept everyone understands. The forests are not only fi=
lled
with predators, but also neighbor the territory of others. Our presence mak=
es
our neighbors realize that they cannot simply take what they want. We patrol
our borders, and by knowing our land well we ensure that others don‚Äôt tak=

they want in secret. Being watchful means being ready to protect what is ou=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Protecting our
culture, the diminished goal, is enclosed in the other two. By protecting
ourselves, we preserve our culture and ourselves. Before the Scourge, many
Woodsmen were sent out from Wyrm Wood to faraway villages and settlements as
representatives of elven culture. While the Discipline is still practiced in
Blood Wood, Woodsmen throughout Barsaive now see their role as guardians of
culture from a different perspective. Many try to re-establish our unity, so
the elven culture as a whole is not lost. They travel throughout the lands =
to
spread the word about our culture, singing our songs, telling our tales, and
teaching elven ways to those that have forgotten and those that didn‚Äôt ha=

weapon other than the sword. Most Swordmasters specializing in another weap=

for all sorts of information, and it comes as no surprise that the City of
Thieves has its share of Namegivers specializing in obtaining it. While most
spies take contracted work, some steal information when the circumstances
allow, trying to find a buyer afterwards. In Barsaive, spies are categorize=
d as
the stealthy type, excelling at entering places unobserved. This is very
different from the methods employed by infiltrators such as the infiltrator
Scout (Player‚Äôs Companion, p.64), who walks openly in, or even joins the =
group
he is targeting, collecting information firsthand. Many a layman confuses s=
pies
and infiltrators, much to the concern of these professionals, who could blow
their cover or unnecessarily reveal their identities to someone who will en=
d up
not hiring them. Members of both groups often work through middlemen for th=

reason. Some individuals try to work in both fields of work, but only
multi-Disciplined adepts are very successful at combining fields.</p>
