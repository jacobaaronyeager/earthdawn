        The adept's presence temporarily nullifies any curses or active spell effects present on an object. It does not alleviate a curse's effects on those already affected by it, but it will allow unaffected characters to handle the object without risk of being cursed or affected by spells. The adept makes an Abate Curse Test against the higher of the highest Step Number of any curse or the highest Dispel Difficulty of any spells present on the object, +1 for each additional curse or spell. If successful, all of the curses and spells are neutralized for a number of hours equal to the adept's Abate Curse Rank‚ their effects are suspended, but their duration is still kept track of. The adept must remain within a number of yards equal to his Abate Curse Rank of the target object throughout the talent's duration or the effect ends.

        The Absorb Damage power allows a questor to add the armor of inspiration to a target character.  The questor talks to the character for 3 rounds, attempting to inspire him by vividly describing the thrill of taking physical risks, then makes an Absorb Damage Test against the target's Social Defense. If the test succeeds, the target adds the questor's Absorb Damage Rank to his Physical Armor. In addition to this effect, increase the result level required to inflict an Armor-Defeating Hit against the target's Physical Armor by one level (from Excellent to Extraordinary, for example).

        The adept performs flips, somersaults, or similar acrobatic maneuvers, making him harder to hit. He must be able to move and have sufficient space to perform maneuvers in. The adept makes an Acrobatic Strike Test against the highest Physical Defense of any opponents in close combat range (1 hex) and must then attack one of the opponents in close combat. If both the Acrobatic Strike Test and the Attack Test are successful, the adept adds his Acrobatic Strike Rank to his Physical Defense against the opponents for the remainder of the round. If the adept is Knocked Down or otherwise finds his movement restricted, he loses this bonus.

      The adept performs quick, gliding movements and rapid attacks in combat. Air Dance requires that the adept be able to move. Windling adepts may use this talent while flying, but it cannot be combined with talents that utilize other forms of magical movement, such as <a class="link talent">Gliding Stride</a>. The adept substitutes his Air Dance Step for his Dexterity Step when making his Initiative Test (see Determine Initiative, p. 214), incurring Initiative Penalties for armor as normal. If making a close combat attack that round, the adept compares his Initiative Test result against his opponent's. On an Excellent Result, the adept may make an additional close combat attack against his opponent, following that character's turn.

require greater ability: the higher an adept's Air Sailing Rank, the bigg=

ship he can command or the higher the position he can fill within a ship's
crew. The adept makes an Air Sailing (5) Test to help propel an airship. If
successful, he effectively takes the place of one crew member for each Resu=
lt
Level achieved. For an airship to stay airborne, at least 25 percent of the
crew must make successful Air Sailing (5) Tests each hour. For example, an
airship with a rowing crew of twenty needs at least five rowers to succeed =
at
Air Sailing Tests to stay afloat. This might be an equivalent number, such =
as
two rowers, one of whom achieved an Extraordinary Result on his Air Sailing
Test (thereby replacing four rowers). If at least 50 percent of the crew ma=

successful tests, the airship can maneuver at its current altitude, dive, or
climb slowly in a straight line. If 75 percent of the crew are successful, =

power allows a questor to create a gift of a work of art that will evoke a
specific, basic emotion in the gift's recipient. Questors usually use this
power to influence a target to feel a certain emotion toward a third party.=
 The
gift may represent any art form, including songs, paintings, poems, and so =
on,
as dictated by the questor's talents and skills. The recipient (the targe=
t of
the power) must accept the gift willingly, whether or not he knows of the
gift's magical charm. For example, a questor could not simply sing a song
powered by Enchanted Gift while in the target character's presence and ha=
ve it
affect the target. The singer would have to ask, ‚ÄúMight I give you the gi=
ft of
a song?‚Äù Once the target accepts the gift, the questor power leaves the g=
ift
and affects the recipient and the object or verse is no longer magical. The
beauty of the gift may make it inherently valuable, however.

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>The questor en=
chants
the gift with a basic emotion, such as fear, love, hate, happiness, anger, =
or
joy. The emotion must be directed at a specific subject, such as a ruler, t=
he
young woman down the street, a nearby citadel, and so on. The recipient of =
the
gift feels the designated emotion for the specific subject. For example, if=
 a
small statue enchanted with love for a specific girl is given to her unmarr=
ied
neighbor, he falls in love with the girl. As soon as the character accepts =
the
gift, the questor makes an Enchanted Gift Test against the target's Social
Defense. If the test succeeds, the target becomes more receptive to suggest=
ions
involving the emotion and subject enchanted into the gift. Characters add t=
he
questor's <a href=3D"onenote:Talents.one#Questor">Questor</a> Rank as a b=
onus to
all Interaction Tests in which they make a positive suggestion related to t=
he
emotion and subject of the enchanted gift. Interaction Tests suggesting
thoughts and ideas opposed to the gift's emotion and subject incur a pena=
lty
equal to the questor's Questor Rank.

 her
native village. Worried that the local warrior, who fancies himself in love
with her, will abandon his task of protecting the village to follow her, she
has created a cloak brooch in the shape of a shield as a parting gift. Using
her Enchanted Gift power, she enchants the brooch with the basic emotion of=
 joy
and directs that emotion toward the village. She presents the brooch to the
warrior as a farewell gift, which he accepts. Nedra makes a successful
Enchanted Gift Test against the warrior's Social Defense of 9. For the ne=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Note that an
enchanted gift can be offered by anyone to anyone else. For example, a child
might pick up an enchanted statuette from a questor's workbench and offer=
 it to
his mother. If the mother accepts the gift, the gamemaster must ask the
questor's player to make an Enchanted Gift Test against the mother's So=

anything but food, or who needs to convince someone who has no intention of

        The adept moves in a graceful fashion through the air, horizontally as well as vertically, using his Movement Rate to glide instead of walking or running. He makes a Gliding Stride Test, the result being the number of hexes he can glide horizontally. The adept is restricted by his Movement Rate for gliding horizontally, but can use the <a>Running</a> combat option to double the distance traveled. For every two hexes he glides horizontally, the adept may move up or down one hex vertically without affecting his total Movement Rate.  The adept cannot go higher, or glide safely lower, than his Gliding Stride Rank in hexes. If the adept happens to be suspended any higher than this in mid-air, he may instinctively activate his Gliding Stride talent to reduce the distance he falls by 2 yards per Rank. Gliding Stride cannot be combined with other talents that allow a special form of movement, such as <a>Sprint</a> or <a>Great Leap</a>.

        <![CDATA[
        Legnaz has a Movement Rate of 6, a Gliding Stride Rank of 8, and has just rolled a 16 on his Gliding Stride Test. He has rolled more distance than he could use if he just wanted to glide horizontally&mdash;his Movement Rate of 6 could be doubled to 12 if Running&mdash; but he wants to go vertically, to glide over a 6-yard-high wall. His game group uses yards in this situation, so he simply multiplies his Test Result by two: 16 hexes equal 32 yards, and his Movement Rate is 12 yards (24 yards if Running). To move upwards 6 yards, he has to move double that distance&mdash;12 yards&mdash;horizontally. This means he can just make it to the top of the wall: 12 yards horizontal gliding constitutes his Movement Rate, and the 6 yards of upwards travel comes free. If he uses the Running combat option, he can move another 12 yards, which would allow him to move 6 yards downwards&mdash;enough movement to get up over the wall and down again in one round.

guide an airship safely through the skies, circumventing storms and turbule=

flying creatures, and other hazards. To pinpoint their location, navigators=

be able to see the sky and must possess a set of navigator's charts. Navi=

most often means relying on the constellations of the Passions, the movemen=

the sun, and similar astrological phenomena for direction. Most maps have t=

constellations drawn around their borders for use with Shantaya's sextant=

similar navigational tools. Consequently, navigation is most effective on c=

determined by the gamemaster, based on the Navigation Table, but modified
depending on the circumstances. Incomplete or inaccurate charts increase the
Difficulty Number by +1 to +5. The Test Result determines the adept's acc=
uracy.
An Average Result gives a position accurate to within 10 miles; a Good Resu=

Extraordinary Result places the navigator within a mile of his target locat=

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>A spell matrix=
 is an
astral construct that allows magicians to cast spells without interference =
from
the denizens of astral space. The Spell Matrix talent represents the most b=
asic
type of spell matrix in Earthdawn. A magician may only safely cast a spell
after he has first placed it into a spell matrix. The Spell Matrix Rank
determines the maximum Spell Circle it can hold. For example, a Rank 2 Spell
Matrix can hold a single First or Second Circle spell. The matrix's Mystic
Armor absorbs damage from attacks directed against it, such as from the <a
href=3D"onenote:Talents.one#Matrix Strike">Matrix Strike</a> talent, and is=
 equal
to the magician's base Mystic Armor. Each Spell Matrix represents a separ=
ate
talent with its own Rank, and is improved independently.

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Versatility is=
 a
racial talent, available only to human adepts (see Versatility, p. 21). A h=
uman
adept with Versatility Ranks may learn talents from Disciplines other than =
his
own, paying the same Legend Point cost as a member of that Discipline would=
 to
gain those talents. The adept must be trained by a member of the appropriate
Discipline for each talent that he learns, something that many Disciplines =
do
not always encourage their members to do. Training time and cost are determ=
ined
by the gamemaster when learning from a gamemaster character, cost and time
involved can get as high as training to advance to a Circle equal to the Ci=
rcle
the tutor learned the talent at. An adept may learn a number of talents from
other Disciplines equal to his Versatility Rank. An adept cannot learn a ta=
lent
from a Circle greater than his highest Discipline Circle. For example, if t=
he
adept's highest Discipline Circle is Third Circle, he can learn talents f=
rom
other Disciplines available to them at Third Circle or lower. As Talent Opt=
ions
can be learned at a range of Circles, they use the Circle the tutoring adept
chose them at to determine if a human could learn them via Versatility. For
example, a Novice Talent Option learned at Seventh Circle only can be learn=

by a Seventh Circle human adept, even if the tutor could have learned it at
Second Circle.

<p style=3D'margin:0in;font-family:Calibri;font-size:11.0pt'>Talents learned
through the use of Versatility are never Discipline Talents. Also, the

(see Advancing Discipline Circles, p. 239). This means that adepts who
consistently use Versatility to learn and improve talents from other
Disciplines will generally take longer to advance through their own Discipl=

own

sources must be found. For each Result Level achieved on a successful
Wilderness Survival Test, the adept finds one quart of water.

the
art of reading a windling's flight or modify one's flight to convey mes=

or messages, such as expressing anger or giving a short command. A Good Res=
ult
conveys more specific emotions or allows for general conversation, such as
expressing fear of Horrors or giving a forecast of tomorrow's weather. An
Excellent Result expresses very complex, even conflicting feelings and the
relations between them or allows to convey detailed information, such as
expressing the joy of no longer feeling fear of the Horror after a glorious
victory or giving instructions to mix the red body paint used by one's cl=
an. An
Extraordinary Result allows for any topic to be expressed. Conveying messag=
es
takes as long as speaking them, so a wind dance may require longer than one
round to perform. Conveying emotions does not convey the character's actu=

effective against members of the same race, the adept can also use this tal=

gamemaster should determine whether such an attempt requires a higher Result
Level to be effective and, if so, how much higher. For example, a human try=

to impress a dwarf may require a Good Result on his Winning Smile Test. That
same human attempting to impress a t'skrang might need an Excellent Resul=
